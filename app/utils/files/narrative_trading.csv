There is reason to believe that the peak of the cycle is not near, as long-term whales are at 234% of purchased gains with 599% reached in February 2021.

Bitcoin's tendency to become highly volatile in uncertain environments has investors fearful that there is still a possibility of escalation in the Middle East.

Factors such as the demand from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the possibility of monetary policy easing contribute to this complexity. While some analysts anticipate Bitcoin's price surging to levels between $200,000 and $500,000 post-halving, the timing and extent of this increase remain uncertain.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Market Dynamics</strong></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"">-</span>	<span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"">Throughout history, the leading crypto-asset has followed a compelling pattern: significant price surges in the 6 to 12 months after halving events.

However, due to escalating costs on the Bitcoin blockchain, Stripe discontinued the service in 2018. Within the same year, Ethereum, a decentralized platform enabling the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), launched its mainnet. This development marked a shift towards more complex use cases for blockchain technology beyond simple transactions. Fast forward to March 2022, Stripe re-entered the cryptocurrency arena, initially supporting NFT purchases and later announcing plans to accept the USDC stablecoin on Ethereum, Solana and Polygon networks.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Stripe's USDC Adoption Impact</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The Stripe announcement is significant due to the company's large scale and reach. International businesses and startups, particularly those using Stripe's technology, now have the opportunity to accept USDC as a form of payment for online transactions. This move could potentially accelerate the adoption of Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon networks, as they are initially supported platforms. Stablecoins like USDC offer merchants the benefits of cryptocurrencies while mitigating volatility, making them a popular choice for quick trade settlements and small-value transactions.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Stripe Ignites Network Growth</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">As a payment processing giant with billions of dollars in monthly transactions, Stripe's entry into the crypto market through supporting USDC on Ethereum, Solana and Polygon networks signifies a significant push for onchain growth for these respective blockchains. By providing merchants with a stable and efficient payment solution, Stripe can considerably expand the reach of USDC and attract more participants to these networks. The volume of transactions facilitated by Stripe will help to increase the overall transactions processed on Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon networks, driving greater demand for their native tokens and overall network usage. The associated fees and gas costs, a common concern for many users, can also help incentivize miners to secure the networks, further bolstering their foundational infrastructure. The integration of Stripe can be compared to a catalyst, igniting growth and legitimizing the networks for the mainstream market, thereby positioning these blockchains for long-term success.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Stripe's Differentiated Crypto Vision</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Compared to competitors like PayPal, which offers a broader range of cryptocurrencies, Stripe's selective approach in supporting specific cryptocurrencies and networks, such as USDC on Ethereum, Solana and Polygon, highlights its commitment to exploring dependable and efficient solutions. This integration signifies a potential turning point for these blockchains. With Stripe's massive user base and the growing trend of stablecoins as a means of exchange, this development could lead to increased transactional volume and, consequently, more extensive network usage. As the crypto market continues to evolve, expansions such as this, which introduce mainstream adoption, are crucial to fostering momentum and driving long-term growth for the involved blockchains.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">With a focus on stablecoins like USDC, Stripe looks to provide merchants and their customers with a more stable and predictable alternative as against the volatile nature of other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin. This approach can help Stripe build trust and reliability in the increasingly complex and rapidly changing world of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Stripe's investment in NFT purchases earlier in 2022 highlights its forward-thinking approach and adaptability to emerging use-cases, which can set it apart from its competitors and further strengthen its position within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.&nbsp;</span></p>","2024-04-29 16:39:21.049378","",2,"2024-07-18 17:12:09.22571+00",""

This indicates that there is less speculative interest around Ethereum from STHs (Short Term Holders) as opposed to Bitcoin, whose interest has increased, leading to strong inflows and accumulation of capital and a rise in its price reaching a new ATH. The lack of speculative interest is one of the reasons why Ethereum is not attracting accumulation and inflow of new capital from STHs, who are also seen as the new investors.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"">Besides, it seems that LTHs or long-term holders of Ethereum are unwilling to sell their holdings en masse, as they are waiting for better opportunities to take profits. This also leads to lower market movements and volatility, which reduces speculation and inflows of new capital.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"">It is also important to note that big investors like Blackrock are choosing Bitcoin over Ethereum, following the market trend.

The initial five ETFs will trade on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), with others expected on Nasdaq and NYSE Arca. This could bring strong capital inflows for crypto due to the entry of institutional players that so far did not find appropriate regulation to invest in ETH and its associated projects, generating higher demand and future upside for the token and its ecosystem.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"">‣ It is worth mentioning that during Thursday and Friday of this week, GDP and Core PCE data will be released, which if positive (GDP in line with expectations or higher, and Core PCE in line or lower), would accentuate the probability of a “soft landing” scenario, having already reduced inflation without achieving a strong impact on gross output due to the very rapid rate hikes.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"">‣ Finally reviewing the Bitcoin price development, it has had a strong rejection to the 53k area recovering the range from 60k.

In this phase, low-cost credit in the Japanese market would cease to be a business to invest in other assets, meaning that the carry trade with the Japanese yen would end. Adding to this, the decline in job creation in the U.S. market reduced the likelihood of the much-desired ""soft landing"" scenario and would result in the FED having to cut rates almost certainly over the next few months.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">What about Crypto and the carry trade roller coaster?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The carry trade refers to an investment strategy where an investor borrows funds in a currency with low interest rates, like the yen. These borrowed funds are then invested in assets denominated in a different currency, such as bonds in US dollars, where interest rates are higher, allowing investors to benefit from the difference in interest rates and achieve a greater return on their investment. As these low rates from the Japanese market have ceased to be cheap, the financing cost of investors who had borrowed has increased, generating a sharp sell-off in invested assets to repay the Japanese currency loans.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Are Macroeconomics and the U.S. Labour Market Affecting Market Sales?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"">‣ In a week full of key macroeconomic events, panic entered the markets due to the lower-than-expected U.S. employment data, which would begin to show the slowdown of the market as a result of high interest rates.

This in turn led to investors having to sell their US assets bought in yen, which would now offer lower returns and even losses, generating strong sales and flight to safe-haven assets such as the Japanese yen, the Euro and the Chinese yuan, unlike the dollar, which has now lost ground sharply.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"">‣ The previous week was one of high volatility in general for all the markets, as the S&amp;P500 generated a slight rebound after rejecting the 5700 points zone downwards, to then strongly reject the 5570 points downwards, thus forming a lower high and ceiling in the short term at least.

The main indicator that the market will follow will be the CPI data for July on Wednesday before the NY stock market opens, which will have a major impact on the Fed's rate cut decision in September. A lower-than-expected inflation data would be positive and would be in line with what the markets are expecting for a continued upward rebound, after having had two positive data releases last week, such as the ISM Services PMI and the weekly Unemployment Claims report. On the contrary, an increase in inflation during July could generate fear in the markets and bearish volatility as this would mean that rates may not be cut deep enough or fast enough to clear doubts about a ""soft landing"".</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"">‣ It is important to mention that there has been a change in trend during this fall for the first time in two years where monetary policy tightening has taken precedence, as the market has returned to considering bad news for the economy as bad news for itself.

There was even talk last week about the possibility of an emergency meeting to determine a rate cut before September, which has not yet occurred. Currently, the discussion is whether the Fed will cut rates in September by 25 or 50 basis points. This rate cut is already being discounted by the market, which means on the one hand that not cutting rates in September would be a bad signal that would generate bearish movements, and on the other hand it leaves the question of how the markets would behave in the event of a 25 or 50 basis point cut.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"">‣ This week the markets will see a lot of US macro data relevant to understand what the coming months will look like, such as Core PPI and Core CPI, Retail Sales and Unemployment Claims.&nbsp; </span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">As is well known, a fall in employment in the context of restrictive monetary policy (high interest rates to absorb liquidity and control inflation) is a warning sign for the markets as it would mean that the economy is starting to slow down, and that future rises in unemployment could occur, generating a snowball effect by the consequent fall in consumption. This not only negatively affects the stock market due to lower earnings projections (and falling asset prices), but also risks assets such as Bitcoin and altcoins, which see investors mostly selling their capital in order to relocate it into safe-haven assets.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"">‣ War conflicts around the world are also affecting market volatility, as wars generally have a negative impact on corporate revenue generation and overall consumption of nations, which in turn has a downward impact on markets.
