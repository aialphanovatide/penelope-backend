This enhanced scalability and improved user experience on Ethereum's layer-2 networks may have potentially driven increased adoption and market sentiment for Layer 0s. </span></li></ul><p class=""ql-align-center""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><img src=""https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/L6kmvc94uyjrPNltb2NXzpLWOR8nqsJJh6ggS7-6BKmhR2wY7BOU-F2yxLXDmlESwgxodKsG8jXdJwK72aBklGDbJtJswn5dL_OVT975nSNiZc2t_OsWJM9j4Pc55mHvO_R3fcyxb8SawwRcpWcVVmU"" height=""372""></span></p><ul><li class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The increase in </span><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">ATOM's</strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""> market capitalization and the small increase in its price may be attributed to the approval of a proposal to reduce the maximum inflation rate of ATOM from 14% to 10% annually. This change could potentially lead to a decrease in the new token supply, fostering scarcity and potentially driving up demand. However, if the reduction in inflation adversely affects validators' incentives, it could impact network security and investor confidence negatively. Furthermore, the rise in market cap could be influenced by Grayscale's launch of a staking product for cryptocurrencies, including ATOM. Grayscale's involvement typically attracts institutional investors and may contribute to increased demand for ATOM. Additionally, the staking product may result in more ATOM being locked in staking contracts, thereby reducing circulating supply.</span></li><li class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">DOT’s</strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""> market cap and price have noticed an increase.

The Substrate framework, specifically developed for Polkadot, plays a crucial role in facilitating interoperability across various blockchains.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(29, 28, 29);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Implications for Future Projects</strong></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(29, 28, 29);"">The ability to facilitate interoperability among various blockchains is a significant advantage for new projects. This feature sets Polkadot apart from competitors in the Layer 0 space, enabling the exchange of assets and information across the network without requiring centralized intermediaries. However, it also poses challenges in ensuring scalability and security in a rapidly growing network. Polkadot is addressing these concerns through collaborations, continuous improvement, and relying on its unique governance model for fair and inclusive decision-making.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(29, 28, 29);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Competitive Analysis: Cosmos vs. Polkadot</strong></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(29, 28, 29);"">Cosmos, presented alongside Polkadot, offers another intriguing solution for Layer 0 platforms. Its protocol, Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), enables interoperability between independent chains as well, much like Polkadot. The main differences lie in their infrastructure capabilities and strategic advantages.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(29, 28, 29);"">Also, Cosmos leverages the Cosmos SDK, which allows for the creation of custom blockchains within the Cosmos Network. It utilizes a delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS) consensus mechanism and focuses on a decentralized exchange for inter-chain asset swaps. Polkadot, on the other hand, uses its unique hybrid Consensus Mechanism, Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS), and dedicated governance token, DOT, that enables stakeholders to vote on proposed upgrades, ecosystem development, and governance decisions.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(29, 28, 29);"">Both projects offer exciting possibilities, but the choice between them depends on the priorities of the developers, investors, and users.

Initially based in China, the company moved its headquarters to the CAYMAN ISLANDS before settling in Malta. Binance has since become one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, reportedly handling over $30 billion in daily trading volume as of February 2023. CZ, a Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur, started his professional career in the tech sector before venturing into cryptocurrencies. In 2014, he began working on Blockchain.info, an open-source block explorer, wallet and API provider. Before establishing Binance, CZ served as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of OKCoin.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Binance Founder Under Scrutiny</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The recent news regarding U.S. prosecutors seeking a three-year prison sentence for CZ in relation to money laundering activities on Binance is significant because of the platform's historical prominence and growth. The allegations against CZ, who stepped down as CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement deal, revolve around the platform's inability to prevent and actively conceal thousands of illicit transactions. Such activities include those supporting child sex abuse, illegal drug trade, terrorism and violations of U.S. sanctions. This puts the spotlight on the cryptocurrency exchange industry's regulatory challenges and the extent to which companies must adhere to international financial and legal guidelines, even as they serve a global client base.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Impact of CZ's Case</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The outcome of this case will have a profound impact on Binance's future operations. Should CZ receive a prison sentence and additional fines or penalties, the damage to Binance's reputation could lead investors to lose confidence and withdraw their funds, resulting in significant declines in trading volume and market capitalization. Additionally, the case serves as a stark reminder for cryptocurrency exchanges to prioritize regulatory compliance and invest heavily in anti-money laundering programs. CZ's absence as the CEO could also lead to uncertainty regarding strategic initiatives and expected growth plans, creating instability in the market. Moreover, the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) actions against Binance may prompt other regulatory bodies and countries to investigate similar allegations against the company, potentially leading to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Binance Fallout: Bitcoin's Price Risk</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Binance's significant market influence, with its vast trading volume and substantial user base, could lead investors to reconsider their stance on cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a secure and trustworthy investment option. The course of this case, including the possible prison sentence and fines for CZ and potential regulatory fallout, has the potential to trigger a sell-off, leading to a decline in Bitcoin's price.&nbsp;</span></p>","2024-04-30 15:23:03.92223",1,"Bitcoin","2024-07-18 17:12:09.22571+00",NULL

Recent price movements show it stabilising within a tight range, with fluctuations confined between $3.80 and $5.58. Despite an attempted break from the market structure observed last week, the price lacked follow-through, potentially signalling a revisit of the recent low to confirm a double-bottom pattern. Traders may monitor this pattern closely for potential trend reversal signals.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"" class=""ql-size-large"">What's Behind the Price Drop?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">-</strong>	<strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">BTC’s correction: </strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">During periods of daily declines in Bitcoin ranging from 1% to 5%, the ALT coin markets often face considerable downturns, with prices typically falling by approximately 20%. Consequently, leading up to the Bitcoin Halving, FXS experienced a significant drop of around 60% over the past 6 weeks. This illustrates the considerable impact that Bitcoin's price movements can have on the broader cryptocurrency market, including ALT coins like FXS.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">-</strong>	<strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The MA100 breakdown: </strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">For short-term and mid-term holders, the 100-day moving average is often considered the strongest, and a price crossing below it frequently triggers a sell-off. When Frax Share's price fell below $9, coinciding with a breakdown below the MA100, it underwent a sharp decline estimated to be around 56%. This highlights the significance of the MA100 as a key level for traders and investors, and how price movements relative to this average can influence market sentiment and trading decisions.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">-</strong>	<strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">General Market Interest: </strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">As the general market capitalization remains subdued, including a lack of enthusiasm in BTC, FXS has also witnessed a decline in retail interest. Moreover, the volume over the past 3 weeks has been decreasing. While this may initially seem concerning, it could actually be interpreted as a positive sign. A decline in volume suggests a drying up of sellers, indicating that bearish momentum may be weakening. This could potentially pave the way for bulls to take control of the market soon. Traders and investors may interpret this as a possible precursor to a bullish reversal in FXS.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">-</strong>	<strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Relative Strength Index (RSI):</strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""> When the RSI dips below 30, it typically indicates an oversold condition and may suggest a severe downtrend. However, if RSI levels are attempting to challenge and stay above the 30 mark, it could signal a potential end to the consolidation phase. This behaviour may indicate that selling pressure is weakening, potentially paving the way for a reversal or a period of consolidation before a possible uptrend. Traders often monitor RSI levels alongside other technical indicators to assess market conditions and identify potential turning points in price movements.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframe</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-center""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><img src=""https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ptKUz2uCn5C4e0kOKPdcGmbsuJqz-Ur147mSD_mFVm8oGBRJffaLwgNPimDEn03cZOodPwWTEWysVqfnGlM7nkQLjFFCUh8OGzfVN0RiBaCnmT1oVlPIyhfBiDllauejEauC3mgrZMspgqf5iZmxc3Q"" height=""291""></strong></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Over the past 3 weeks, FXS has remained relatively stagnant despite operating in a ranging market, with volume constantly staying below average.

This infrastructure is essential for Cosmos as it fosters interoperability, a critical component for competition in the Layer 0 space. Substrate, developed by the Web3 Foundation, allows for the creation of custom-built blockchains that can communicate with each other, enhancing the functionality and value of each individual network (Polkadot, Kusama, etc.). This interconnectedness can be advantageous for Cosmos as it aims to be a competitive interoperability platform.</span></p><p><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"">Polkadot: Seamless Integration</strong></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Polkadot's development and adoption of interoperability via the Substrate framework and its various staking options correlate to the essential aspects of Layer 0 technologies - security, scalability, and decentralization. Staking helps secure the network and offers users a passive income, while interoperability increases utility and connectivity among various blockchains.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Shaping Future Layer 0</strong></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Developments like Polkadot's interoperability and staking could set a precedent for future Layer 0 projects that choose to build on similar frameworks, leveraging interoperability as a strategic advantage. However, it is vital to acknowledge the risks associated with these staking mechanisms, such as protocol-level risks and potential censorship from centralized exchanges.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Cosmos: Interoperability Unleashed</strong></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Cosmos, another Layer 0 protocol, distinguishes itself from competitors like Polkadot and Quant by focusing on interoperability via the Cosmos-SDK. While Cosmos Share (ATOM) staking, like its competitors, serves to secure the network and provide rewards, its interoperable nature sets it apart, allowing it to connect with various independent, parallel blockchains. This interoperability, facilitated by the IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol, can potentially give Cosmos a strong strategic advantage, making it an appealing option for both developers and users seeking a more comprehensive, cohesive blockchain ecosystem.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">In terms of infrastructure capabilities, Cosmos's focus on interchain communication through the IBC protocol allows for seamless interaction between multiple independent blockchains, increasing its potential for usability and practical applications across various industries. In contrast, Polkadot and Quant carry their unique flavours of interconnectedness via their respective Parachains and Overledger protocols. While both have their merits, Cosmos's singular focus on interoperability may give it an edge in terms of ease of use and integration possibilities within its ecosystem.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Additionally, Cosmos's independently governed Hub is another factor that could provide strategic advantages in the long run. This approach minimizes the centralization risks associated with a single control centre while maintaining the flexibility and adaptability of a decentralized ecosystem. Users and developers alike can trust that innovation within the network will be driven by the community rather than a singular entity.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">In conclusion, the developments surrounding staking and interoperability in Layer 0 protocols like Cosmos, Polkadot, and Quant, are significant in shaping the future of these projects and the broader blockchain industry as a whole. By adopting innovative staking mechanisms and a focus on interoperability, these Layer 0 platforms pave the way for a more interconnected, decentralized, and complex blockchain ecosystem where individual projects can thrive and contribute to larger expansion and innovation.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">However, it's essential to remember that risks do exist within these systems, such as potential centralization risks in the case of Cosmos and Quant's Hubs or the higher protocol-level risks in third-party decentralized protocols. As always, users and investors must evaluate these risks, ensure they're comfortable with the trade-offs and exercise due diligence when staking their assets.</span></p>","2024-05-02 18:53:37.943873",8,"RootLink","2024-07-18 17:12:09.22571+00",NULL

In response to the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, investors have been keen on regulated investment avenues to access Ethereum's potential, mirroring the demand for regulated Bitcoin ETFs. Notable investment firms such as VanEck and ARK Invest have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Ethereum spot ETFs. These ETFs would offer investors exposure to the underlying cryptocurrency, providing benefits like convenience, instant liquidity, and opportunities for short-selling. However, the development of these investment products hinges on the SEC's classification of Ethereum as either a commodity or a security, a distinction crucial for determining Ethereum's institutional acceptance and future growth prospects.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">ETH ETF Approval Hurdles</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Michael Saylor's prediction that the SEC may classify Ethereum as a security fuels growing concerns regarding the regulatory landscape for Ethereum and its prospective ETFs. As a vocal advocate for Bitcoin and its institutional acceptance, Saylor's stance adds gravity to the ongoing debate within the crypto community. The regulatory distinction between Bitcoin and Ethereum remains unclear, and the classification of Ethereum as a security may complicate the approval process for ETFs and impose additional reporting and compliance requirements on the Ethereum network and its participants.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">SEC Classification Concerns</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">If Ethereum is classified as a security, it would significantly alter the regulatory landscape for ETH and ETF applicants. The Howey Test, the SEC's primary tool for determining the definition of a security, might not align with Ethereum's decentralized nature, making it challenging for ETFs to directly track the underlying asset. The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 could potentially apply to Ethereum, bringing increased reporting and compliance requirements. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum may deter institutional investors, as they prefer the ease and regulatory safety offered by ETFs, resulting in a negative impact on Ethereum's adoption and potential market performance.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Growth Amid Regulations</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Despite the regulatory challenges, Ethereum's rapid progress in DeFi and NFTs sectors underscores its continuous growth potential and significance within the crypto landscape. Institutions eyeing Ethereum exposure may consider alternative investment vehicles, such as investment trusts or actively managed funds, which could circumvent the regulatory hurdles surrounding Ethereum ETFs. Furthermore, the increasing popularity and adoption of decentralized finance, which operates on Ethereum's blockchain, suggest that the Ethereum ecosystem's innovation and expansion may not be impeded by the regulatory concerns alone. Thus, Ethereum's future growth and acceptance may not hinge entirely on the regulatory decisions surrounding its ETFs but on its continued development and integration into established financial systems.</span></p>","2024-05-06 18:56:51.876827",2,"Ethereum","2024-07-18 17:12:09.22571+00",NULL

Historically, such partnerships have served dual purposes: marketing and fan engagement. Notable examples include sponsorships by cryptocurrency exchanges like FTX and Binance in major sports events and teams, and the introduction of fan tokens by platforms such as Chiliz.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Layer 0 protocols, which provide the underlying infrastructure for other blockchains, have also begun to explore these opportunities. Polkadot (DOT), Cosmos (ATOM), and Quant (QNT) have not been as active in sports partnerships compared to more prominent Layer 1 blockchains. However, their involvement in such collaborations could significantly impact their visibility and user engagement. Polkadot's recent move to sponsor Conor Daly marks a notable step for an L0 protocol in leveraging sports sponsorships for broader recognition and engagement.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Polkadot’s Community-Driven Sponsorship</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The sponsorship of race car driver Conor Daly by the Polkadot community is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it represents the first major athlete sponsorship decided by community vote using blockchain technology, showcasing a practical application of decentralized governance. This approach differentiates the protocol from traditional corporate sponsorships, emphasizing the power and potential of decentralized decision-making.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">This development ties into the historical context by extending the use of blockchain technology beyond financial transactions and fan tokens, demonstrating its capability in orchestrating large-scale, community-driven initiatives. Polkadot’s community voting mechanism, OpenGov #514, receiving 95.8% approval, illustrates the growing trust and participation in decentralized systems, aligning with the broader trend of increasing blockchain adoption in various sectors.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Sponsorship Influences DOT’s Growth</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Increased visibility from Daly's participation in high-profile racing events like the Indianapolis 500 can attract new users and investors to the Polkadot ecosystem.

The effectiveness of this sponsorship in driving long-term engagement and investment remains uncertain. If the initiative fails to convert fan engagement into actual adoption of Polkadot's technology, the impact on TVL and market cap may be minimal. Additionally, the allocation of 290,000 DOT to fund the sponsorship could be seen as a risk if it doesn't yield the expected returns, potentially leading to criticism from stakeholders.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Distinctive Marketing Strategy</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">This sponsorship positions DOT distinctively against competitors like Cosmos (ATOM) and Quant (QNT). While ATOM and QNT have focused more on technical advancements and interoperability solutions, Polkadot’s move into sports sponsorships represents a strategic diversification. This approach could enhance its brand visibility and user engagement more effectively than purely technical marketing strategies.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">As of now, neither Cosmos nor Quant has engaged in high-profile sports partnerships. This lack of similar initiatives from ATOM and QNT means Polkadot's unique strategy could give it a competitive edge in terms of mainstream recognition and adoption. However, this differentiation also comes with risks. If its foray into sports sponsorship does not translate into tangible growth, it could be perceived as a misallocation of resources compared to its competitors who are focusing on enhancing their core technological capabilities.</span></p>","2024-05-28 16:44:49.372152",8,"RootLink","2024-07-18 17:12:09.22571+00",NULL

Its recent upward momentum gained around 90% within three weeks, moving from $100 to $205. Currently, SOL has entered the bullish side of the consolidation levels, trading above the middle line of the Darvas Box and the Fibonacci 50% retracement level, aiming to challenge the immediate resistance.

Initially, crypto gaming emerged with simple blockchain-based games, leveraging tokens for in-game assets and economies. These early attempts were rudimentary but laid the groundwork for more sophisticated applications. The rise of Ethereum introduced the concept of NFTs, enabling unique digital ownership and sparking a wave of collectible and play-to-earn games. As the DeFi space expanded, the idea of integrating financial elements within games gained traction. By 2021, platforms like Axie Infinity demonstrated the potential of blockchain gaming, showing substantial user engagement and revenue generation. However, high transaction fees and scalability issues on Ethereum highlighted the need for Layer 2 solutions to handle the growing demand efficiently.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Arbitrum Targets Gaming Growth</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The approval of the Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) by Arbitrum's DAO is a significant development in the context of crypto gaming's evolution. This initiative signals a strategic shift by Arbitrum, a protocol primarily known for its DeFi success, into the expanding gaming sector. Historically, Layer 2 solutions have been critical in addressing Ethereum's scalability issues, enabling more complex and transaction-heavy applications like gaming. The GCP aims to leverage Arbitrum's technological advantages to attract top-tier game developers and establish a robust gaming ecosystem.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">GCP's Financial Implications</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The GCP's implementation is likely to have a substantial impact on Arbitrum's TVL and market capitalization. By committing 200 million ARB over three years, Arbitrum aims to foster a vibrant gaming ecosystem, which could drive significant user and developer activity on the platform. Increased gaming projects can lead to higher transaction volumes, thereby boosting TVL. Additionally, successful games can attract new users and investors, positively influencing ARB's market cap. However, there are potential downsides. The success of the GCP depends on attracting high-quality projects and retaining developer interest. If the initiative fails to deliver compelling games or faces governance issues, it could negatively impact investor confidence and Arbitrum's market position.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Gaming Partnerships Comparison</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Arbitrum's Gaming Catalyst Program sets it apart from competitors like Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP), which also have initiatives in the gaming space but on different scales. Polygon has made significant inroads with partnerships in the gaming industry, such as collaborations with Decentraland and The Sandbox. Optimism, while focused more on DeFi, has yet to announce a gaming initiative of comparable scale. Arbitrum's comprehensive approach, including substantial financial commitment, specialized teams, and infrastructure development, positions it as a formidable player in the crypto gaming arena. However, the competitive landscape is dynamic, and Arbitrum must deliver on its promises to maintain its edge. The potential for saturation in the gaming market and the need for continuous innovation and support could pose challenges.</span></p>","2024-05-29 18:43:18.879111",17,"BoostLayer","2024-07-18 17:12:09.22571+00",NULL

Starting with Bitcoin futures in December 2017, followed by Ethereum in 2021, CME has played a crucial role in legitimizing cryptocurrency as an asset class for institutional investors. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, is a high-performance blockchain known for its scalability and low transaction costs.

It contradicts previous industry speculation and dampens hopes for SOL's inclusion in mainstream financial instruments like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This decision is rooted in ongoing legal and regulatory challenges faced by Solana and the broader cryptocurrency market. The mention by finance lawyer Scott Johnsson highlights the legal hurdles, especially given the lawsuits against major exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance.

Furthermore, the reduced likelihood of SOL achieving ETF status in the near future restricts its accessibility to a broader investor base, potentially stalling its adoption and growth in TVL. The relatively stable price of SOL despite the news suggests that the market had not heavily priced in the expectation of futures listings, but this stability may not hold if regulatory challenges persist.</span></p>","2024-06-04 18:26:21.550911",11,"BaseBlock","2024-07-18 17:12:09.22571+00",NULL

However, FTM saw a 50% pullback as the broader market corrected at the end of the first quarter of this year. Recently, a crypto whale made a significant investment in Fantom (FTM) tokens, acquiring 2.818 million FTM for 2.23 million USDC. This investment may be supported by Fantom’s upcoming upgrade to its Opera chain, which was approved after reaching a 66% consensus. The upgrade, aligned with October 2023’s Sonic test net phase, will enable Opera to process 180 million daily transactions with sub-second confirmation times, achieving 2,000 TPS for complex transactions, 4,000 TPS for token swaps, and 10,000 TPS for token transfers. Despite these performance enhancements, Fantom is still in a larger consolidation phase, retesting the flip zone levels after breaking out above its 30-day consolidation range.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Market Movement Analysis</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">-</strong>	<strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Market Interest: </strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">With its high-performance blockchain technology for scalability and fast transaction rates, Fantom (FTM) distinguishes itself from other cryptocurrencies. Fantom’s technological prowess makes it a major player in distributed apps, attracting developers and tech enthusiasts seeking innovative solutions. Despite its impressive technological capabilities, Fantom (FTM) has struggled to achieve widespread market acceptance and generate significant financial returns.

This move would signal strong bullish momentum and attract more investors and traders, further supporting the upward trend.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Considering the current status of the moving averages on the FTM chart, it's noteworthy that the nearest moving average (MA20) has recently been respected over the past few weeks.

This suggests a persistent underlying bullish sentiment despite FTM's 50% decline. The RSI's resilience above 50 indicates that the recent pullback could be viewed as a healthy correction within a broader uptrend rather than a bearish reversal.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">1-Day Technical Analysis</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-center""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><img src=""https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfeNwi2qfTJ33vLbpJbAsd3T_Aif-JCywcg9rT4Tgtzv2C2idlvoHCXAcJck0Zx3NgJ6-u-YnljRcvHSsJCTl5tSnPkAdd_GoOPSUWL5l2KUfDzdpWD7vAy6xRxur-S6Tv0KQoFe14RyplzpKhcu2Ph1CI8?key=GHjOHHTmWsbwaEoOHmISoA"" height=""289""></span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">During the recent bullish surge across the general market, Fantom's (FTM) attempt to break above the middle line of the Darvas Box on the daily timeframe faced rejection, as indicated by the candlestick patterns.

Historically, the protocol's daily transactions hovered around 300,000 in mid-2023, reflecting a modest but consistent user base. However, the recent surge to 6 million daily transactions by late May 2024 represents a substantial shift. This increase is not just a random spike but the result of sustained growth, with total transactions rising from 300 million in late August 2023 to an impressive 1.3 billion recently. This historical context underscores the protocol's growing utility and adoption in the crypto ecosystem.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Significance of NEAR's Surge</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The reported surge in daily transactions to 6 million is a pivotal moment for Near Protocol. This growth trajectory builds on the historical context of steady increase, indicating that Near has transitioned from a phase of gradual adoption to a more rapid expansion. This surge is particularly important as it reflects broader trends within the ecosystem, such as the doubling of wallet creations from 30 million in September 2023 to 75 million recently. Moreover, the integration of NEAR with OKX's Web3 wallet on May 28, which facilitates seamless transfers to 95 different blockchains, likely played a crucial role in accelerating this transaction growth. These developments suggest a robust infrastructure and increasing interoperability, making NEAR more attractive to both users and developers.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">NEAR's Future: TVL Insights</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The significant increase in daily transactions and wallet creations bodes well for Near Protocol’s future, particularly concerning its TVL and Market Cap. The rise in transaction volume and active wallets indicates higher user engagement and activity, which typically correlates with increased TVL as more assets are deployed within the ecosystem. The NEAR token's substantial 350% gain over the past year, despite a recent 4% drop, reflects growing investor confidence. However, sustained growth depends on continued user retention and the effectiveness of partnerships, like those with Cosmose AI and Sweat Economy. While these partnerships enhance Near's ecosystem, there's a potential downside if the rapid user acquisition does not translate into long-term engagement and transaction stability.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Competitive Advantages</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The integration with OKX and significant increases in transaction volume and wallet creation demonstrate Near's robust ecosystem and user appeal. Unlike FTM and KAS, NEAR has shown a remarkable ability to scale rapidly while maintaining interoperability across multiple blockchains. Furthermore, the success of applications like Kai-Ching and Sweat Economy, which have driven substantial user activity, underscores Near's diverse use cases and strong developer community. However, it is essential to note that the competitive landscape is dynamic, and NEAR must continue to innovate and address potential scalability issues to maintain its edge. As with any fast-growing protocol, the sustainability of these gains is contingent on ongoing user engagement and network performance.</span></p>","2024-06-05 13:58:10.219852",13,"CoreChain","2024-07-18 17:12:09.22571+00",NULL

These upgrades are part of the network’s broader strategy to facilitate interoperability among various blockchains through its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Previous upgrades have introduced significant features like IBC, which allows different blockchains to communicate and exchange value seamlessly, and the Gravity DEX, which provides decentralized exchange capabilities. Each upgrade typically involves rigorous testing and community input to ensure robustness and reliability. However, the dynamic nature of blockchain technology means that even well-planned upgrades can encounter unforeseen issues, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring and swift problem resolution.</span></p><p><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Recent Upgrade's Critical Role</strong></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The recent v17 upgrade of the Cosmos Hub, which aimed to integrate the Liquid Staking Module, underscores the network’s commitment to advancing its staking capabilities and enhancing user participation in governance. Liquid staking allows users to stake their ATOM coins while maintaining liquidity, thus improving capital efficiency. However, during this upgrade, a vulnerability in the Liquid Staking Module caused a temporary halt in the blockchain’s operation. This incident is a reminder of the inherent risks associated with implementing new features in complex systems. The quick identification and resolution of the issue by the development teams, Informal Systems and Hypha Cosmos, align with the Cosmos Hub’s historical emphasis on transparency and continuous improvement. The forthcoming post-mortem report will provide valuable insights into the nature of the vulnerability and the steps taken to mitigate it, further demonstrating the network's dedication to security and accountability.</span></p><p><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Future Implications for ATOM</strong></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The swift recovery from the outage is likely to have mixed implications for ATOM’s future. On the positive side, the prompt resolution and commitment to transparency may reinforce investor and user confidence in the network’s resilience and governance. This could potentially stabilize or even enhance ATOM’s market cap and TVL in the short to medium term. However, the incident also exposes the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with protocol upgrades, which could lead to caution among investors and users. The market’s reaction will depend heavily on the detailed findings of the post-mortem report and the perceived effectiveness of the measures implemented to prevent similar issues in the future. Any lingering concerns about the network’s stability could dampen enthusiasm and impact both TVL and market cap negatively.</span></p>","2024-06-11 15:38:44.442918",7,"RootLink","2024-07-18 17:12:09.22571+00",NULL

Its development is structured into five eras: Byron, which established the fundamental architecture and launched the mainnet; Shelley, which decentralized the network through staking pools; Goguen, which integrated smart contracts for decentralized applications (dApps); Basho, currently focusing on scalability and interoperability; and Voltaire, aimed at achieving self-sustainability through decentralized governance systems, including voting and treasury mechanisms, marking the culmination of Cardano's developmental roadmap.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Voltaire Era's Strategic Importance</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The upcoming Chang fork represents a critical milestone as it facilitates the transition to the Voltaire era. Historically, each phase of Cardano's development has introduced significant improvements. The Chang fork will integrate crucial governance mechanisms, including a proposal system for network improvements, a stakeholder voting system, and a treasury system to fund future developments. These enhancements are intended to achieve full decentralization and empower the Cardano community to govern the network autonomously, marking the completion of Cardano’s developmental roadmap.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Chang Fork Market Effects</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The Chang fork's introduction of governance features is a pivotal step toward Cardano's goal of self-sustainability. By enabling community-driven proposals and funding through a decentralized treasury, the network aims to foster continuous adaptability. This shift could enhance investor confidence and potentially lead to increased adoption, impacting ADA’s market cap positively. However, the implementation of such systems is complex and may face challenges, including ensuring effective participation and preventing governance attacks. Moreover, the success of the Voltaire era in driving TVL depends on the community's engagement and the effectiveness of the new governance systems. If executed well, these upgrades could make Cardano more attractive to developers and users, boosting the ecosystem’s growth and ADA’s value. On the flip side, if the governance mechanisms fail to operate as intended or encounter significant resistance, it could hamper Cardano's progress and affect its market perception.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">ADA Performance and Concerns</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Despite Cardano’s strong fundamentals, critics argue that its development pace has been slow and its ecosystem less vibrant compared to rivals. Additionally, the price performance of ADA has faced scrutiny, with some investors skeptical about its long-term viability. Another challenge lies in the execution of the proposed governance mechanisms. Effective decentralized governance requires active and informed participation from stakeholders, which can be difficult to achieve. There is also the risk of governance attacks or manipulation by a small group of influential stakeholders, which could undermine the system's integrity.</span></p>","2024-06-11 18:01:25.143644",10,"BaseBlock","2024-07-18 17:12:09.22571+00",NULL

As a decentralized liquidity protocol, Hydration’s mission has been to provide a flexible and efficient liquidity provisioning system. This project has steadily evolved, contributing to Polkadot's broader vision of a seamless, interconnected blockchain network. The latest funding initiative is a continuation of this historical relationship, aimed at further enhancing liquidity and expanding Polkadot’s DeFi capabilities.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Hydration Funding's Strategic Importance</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The allocation of $14.4 million to Hydration is a significant development in the context of Polkadot's ongoing strategy to bolster its ecosystem. This funding is a clear indication of Polkadot's commitment to enhancing liquidity within its network, which is vital for attracting and retaining users and developers. By consistently funding projects like Hydration, Polkadot not only supports existing DeFi protocols but also signals its dedication to long-term ecosystem development. Providing substantial financial support to Hydration, Polkadot aims to create a more attractive environment for liquidity providers, which is expected to lead to increased participation and network utility. This allocation also reflects Polkadot’s adaptive strategy in responding to the evolving needs of its ecosystem, maintaining its competitive edge in the blockchain industry.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Evaluating DOT’s Financial Strategy</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Increasing liquidity within the Polkadot ecosystem can enhance the network’s attractiveness, potentially driving up the TVL as more users and assets are drawn to the platform.

However, this positive outlook is not without risks. The success of this initiative hinges on the effective implementation and management of the funds. If the expected liquidity boost and associated rewards fail to materialize, or if the newly attracted liquidity providers do not stay long-term, the anticipated benefits might not be fully realized. Moreover, the broader market conditions and competitive landscape within the DeFi space could impact the outcomes of this funding initiative.</span></p>","2024-06-12 18:11:08.265288",8,"RootLink","2024-07-18 17:12:09.22571+00",NULL

The $2 mark is seen as a strong support level by investors, not only due to its psychological significance but also because of historical consolidation around December 2023.

However, FTM faced a 50% pullback as the broader market corrected at the end of the first quarter of this year.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(13, 13, 13);"">Despite speculation that FTM has entered an opportunity zone for accumulation, the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio indicates that bearish forces are still influencing the token's direction.

This was achieved through its unique architecture, which includes the Relay Chain, the core network that provides shared security and consensus, and parachains, which are individual blockchains that run in parallel. One of the key challenges Polkadot has faced is increasing the throughput of these parachains without compromising security. Traditional methods of scaling, such as increasing block size or reducing block time, often lead to centralization risks and decreased network security. Elastic Scaling has emerged as a potential solution to this problem. By allowing parachains to produce multiple blocks for each Relay Chain block, which are then validated in parallel, Polkadot aims to enhance throughput efficiently. This is akin to multi-core processing in computers, where multiple tasks are executed simultaneously.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Scalability Solution for DOT</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Historically, Polkadot has sought to balance scalability, security, and decentralization. Elastic Scaling directly addresses this triad by allowing for greater throughput without the typical trade-offs. The new model introduces Agile Coretime, which departs from the traditional auction system where projects bid for long-term parachain slots. Instead, projects can purchase coretime for shorter durations based on their specific needs. This flexible approach means that projects can scale their operations up or down based on demand, thereby optimizing their performance and cost-efficiency. By providing a mechanism for more dynamic and efficient resource allocation, Elastic Scaling not only enhances the scalability of the network but also makes it more adaptable to the varying needs of different projects.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Elastic Scaling Economic Effects</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The implementation of Elastic Scaling could have significant implications for Polkadot's native token, DOT. Enhanced scalability and cost-efficiency are likely to attract more projects to the Polkadot ecosystem, potentially increasing the network’s TVL. A higher TVL indicates greater utility and adoption of the network, which can positively influence DOT’s market cap.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Competitive Edge Explained</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Polkadot's Elastic Scaling model sets it apart from competitors like Cosmos (ATOM) and Quant (QNT) by integrating scalability directly into its core architecture. While Cosmos focuses on interoperability and relies on individual blockchains to manage their own scaling solutions, and Quant connects networks at the application level without addressing intra-chain scalability, Polkadot offers a more cohesive approach. The combination of built-in scalability and adaptability positions Polkadot as a versatile and efficient platform, although its success will depend on the effective management of these advanced features and the ecosystem's response.</span></p>","2024-06-25 19:33:26.796718",8,"RootLink","2024-07-18 17:12:09.22571+00",NULL

In May 2023, Marathon began evaluating Kaspa as a potential way to diversify its revenue while utilizing its existing infrastructure and expertise in digital assets. After successfully deploying its first Kaspa ASICs in September 2023, the company scaled its operations. As of June 25, 2024, Marathon has mined 93 million KAS, valued at approximately $15 million.

This upgrade introduced a mechanism where a portion of transaction fees is permanently removed from circulation, or ""burned,"" thereby reducing the total supply of ETH. The burn rate has since become a key metric for understanding Ethereum's deflationary potential. Historically, periods of high network activity, such as during bull markets or the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), have led to increased burn rates. This activity reflected Ethereum's growing utility Recently, the Ethereum network has burned just over 460,000 ETH in 2024. As of August 5, 2024, CoinGecko reports 465,657 ETH have been burned this year. In Q2 2024, only 107,725 ETH were burned, a 67.7% drop from the first quarter's 333,555 ETH. July 2024 saw a record low for the year, with just 17,114 ETH burned—a 35% decrease from June. Ethereum emissions have outpaced burns, with 540,958 ETH added to the network since the start of 2024, leaving a net total of 75,301 ETH added.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The recent burn rate highlights a sharp decline in Ethereum's burn rate in 2024, with a significant drop in Q2 compared to Q1 and a monthly low in July. This decline is particularly notable because it represents a reversal of the deflationary trend that had been a key selling point for Ethereum since the introduction of EIP-1559. The shift from deflationary to inflationary conditions suggests that network activity has slowed down considerably, which could be a concern for those who view ETH's deflationary nature as a key component of its value proposition.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Is ETH Stuck in a Downtrend or Ready to Break Free?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-center""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><img src=""https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcqpSvEJDdYz3dwM79z5siHAj-shjFt8S9jLn2-BdPnvsCgOFeIKU1jc1A7Zq3Ghcel24Idq9XFIO4Tl3JylykV0RkwGGQYrV7YKrnspqjAFtT8ypcHMDAYQFaFlZQxh--XVx7Ey4wOBSrmaWu8I2XhlJU7?key=qkb7kKQfimdACcZT7F4vpQ"" height=""273""></strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Against BTC, ETH is currently in a downtrend since September 2022 as it failed to maintain the $0.066 level considered as a higher-low structure of the pair.

By the time ETH/BTC move towards $0.0586, the 100-day moving average (moving average in color purple) also hovers around the said level marking it as another potential resistance. The decline in burn rate led to Ethereum turning inflationary again for the first time since The Merge in September 2022 and is impacting the recent price declining at roughly 25% coming from $0.05 down to $0.04 against BTC.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Inflation Pressures and Resistance: Can ETH Break Through?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-center""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><img src=""https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcvciJWFsteR0RfuHlbhufm-Gbiv8NNvxERUkgqr2GIjX7r8Pn2PDOMMErBhVcCNNREmcf7Q8l-n9uaaBG4OJms95qwjzS-o1oSd9Zzkgx8PBLz2Ew6rYvBNZ2mB_XSdOAqwOE7K-e68H3lselwXERZe4J_?key=qkb7kKQfimdACcZT7F4vpQ"" height=""273""></strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">With the network being deflationary for only 7 days in Q2 of 2024, compared to 66 days in Q1, since July, ETH's price has fallen from $3,561 to $2,127, a 40% decline over three weeks.

Operating on BandChain, a blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK, Band Protocol is compatible with major blockchains like Ethereum, Polkadot, and Solana. It supports multiple data retrieval methods and enables developers to create custom oracles using WebAssembly. The platform’s native token, BAND, is used for staking, governance, and payment for data services, incentivizing participation and securing the network.

This upgrade aims to boost the performance of Band Protocol's oracle services by increasing throughput and reducing latency, allowing for faster and more efficient data processing. Additionally, the update is expected to lower base fees, making the platform more cost-effective and attractive to new projects. V3 will also simplify the deployment of Oracle scripts, reducing the need for specialized knowledge and promoting broader adoption among developers. These improvements are likely to enhance Band Protocol's market presence and could positively influence the price of the BAND token as the platform appeals to a wider range of users and projects. However, the exact timing of the V3 launch remains undisclosed.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">A notable feature of the BAND V3 update is the introduction of stBAND, developed in collaboration with STRIDE, a liquid staking platform within the Cosmos ecosystem.

After the success of Bitcoin ETFs and the regulatory green light for Solana-based ETFs, Brazil is clearly saying, “We’re ready for more.” This Ethereum ETF marks a new chapter, not just for Brazil but for global crypto markets.

The simplicity and security of ETFs might tempt some investors to reduce their direct ETH holdings, preferring the more traditional route over the complexities of managing ETH on-chain.

We’ve seen the London Hard Fork and The Merge, both of which aimed to tackle Ethereum’s well-known issues with scalability and high transaction costs. Now, we’ve got the Dencun upgrade, which is supposed to make things better by cutting transaction costs and boosting efficiency on Layer 2 (L2) solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base.

It’s another reminder that, for all the planning and tech wizardry, Ethereum’s journey to scalability is far from straightforward.

The 20-week SMA (in red) is hovering above the 50-week SMA (in blue), with the candles sandwiched in between.

But before you start ringing the alarm bells, there’s a potential bullish scenario: the price is sitting on two important support levels. The lower channel line coincides with the 50-week moving average, and the 50-week SMA tends to act as a safety net for mid-term holders.

This rate dictates the cost for commercial banks borrowing from the ECB, and a 25 basis points cut is widely expected. However, the real drama lies in the ECB's internal debate: Is the economic slowdown enough to ease inflation fears, or is the hawkish stance still in play?

A drop below the critical 100 mark would be troubling for the dollar, but a faltering Euro could keep it above this threshold.

When interest rates fall, there’s less incentive to stick with boring fixed-income investments, and traders start hunting for bigger returns in equities and crypto. On top of that, cheaper financing costs make companies more profitable, which can drive stock prices even higher, adding fuel to market rallies.</p><p>But, What’s Next? If the Fed does go ahead with a 50bps rate cut, it’ll probably light a fire under markets but don’t expect a straight shot to the moon. We’re in a delicate balancing act between inflation, employment, and economic growth. While the CPI report might have set the stage for a rally, investors will be watching closely for signs of how the broader economy reacts to the Fed’s next move.</p><p><strong class=""ql-size-large"">S&amp;P500 After CPI: A Downturn or a Setup?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-center""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><img src=""https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXftgs4QR7eE99gf6_XXNTHsthU1w0tTUgNU0fgnGBaYHNcTG4QvZAxn1veOaJ_W6ZEFIwpvfPal-ed-YwOwfci6J2emwz9oxP-vTkKLiKDjtOPRga4BPrNUH-TKlYk30xWXrvUWefCcjiIQjVbX6ejMhlmF?key=Cj8Ny0nT1jeGbTeK7V-cZQ"" height=""335""></strong></p><p class=""ql-align-center""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-small"">S&amp;P500 4H Chart</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Following the CPI data release and the NY session's start, the S&amp;P500 dipped, testing the $5400 mark, but it’s currently on the mend.

This partnership, unveiled on September 10th, aims to supercharge VELO's USDV stablecoin by backing it with BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). Sounds promising, right? Well, despite the fanfare, VELO’s price took a hit, dropping over 22% in the past day. This drop is a textbook example of “sell the news”—where initial excitement turns into a sell-off as speculators cash in on recent gains. It’s a familiar pattern, seen with other crypto projects like Ondo Finance and Injective, which also leveraged BlackRock’s fund for added appeal and yield.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">So, while VELO’s move looks smart, the market’s reaction reminds us that news doesn’t always guarantee a price uptick.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">However, after a few days, VELO is now recovering and potentially continues its base building while it also starts to bend the trend which is an early sign of reversal.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">VELO’s Symmetrical Triangle: What’s Next for the Price?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-center""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><img src=""https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfS92KoNyH_sRrf719DJOH_ypIvB9GUko5DSZCrrBIayMa3p7F-1CjPqFe8SIxjuuZApnbnF22Uip_czaVHIEZuheqMQQ_Cl1tieWtaVNKtx8KFX2BaF1rjdBAdu-RFR-6-C_p1yGYOVROMCdhmT6_QCP4?key=OdV0_KsYhqSMWX4gn94u7g"" height=""449""></span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The VELO/BTC chart is setting the stage for some exciting action with a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern, marked by converging trendlines, shows VELO consolidating before it makes a move. The upper trendline, linking a series of lower highs, represents stiff resistance, while the lower trendline, connecting higher lows, marks strong support. As VELO's price squeezes towards the triangle’s point, a breakout is looming. Watch for key levels: resistance at around 0.00000038 and support at 0.000000087. If VELO breaks above resistance, it could signal a bullish surge; if it falls below support, we might see bearish pressure.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Adding to the drama, VELO’s recent partnership with BlackRock could be a game-changer. By boosting the USDV stablecoin with BlackRock’s fund, VELO aims to enhance its appeal and credibility. This move fits into a larger trend of tokenization in finance, potentially attracting more institutional interest and cementing VELO’s place in the financial ecosystem.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">VELO’s Price Action: Bullish Bounce or Bearish Trap?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-center""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><img src=""https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfJDMNJQ913hHLSblYSQbhRQX5E2td-8XZIGMFocdd5jU1_KfROTS99NMRkog77QOBLrPil4toK_J55FLCTNJQnMX3JWMtXCxSz0XghywxbS_ObLT4EcV1jRXBn4Jo6a-42YSQM-G_-F2-KIDanG8x9khtt?key=OdV0_KsYhqSMWX4gn94u7g"" height=""273""></span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">VELO/USDT is currently priced at around $0.0149, having taken a nosedive from its previous highs and now settling into these lower ranges. The moving averages paint a somewhat optimistic picture: the 20-week SMA sits at $0.0138551, and VELO is comfortably above it, as well as above the 50-week (in green) and 100-week (in purple) SMAs. This setup hints at some bullish momentum, suggesting that upward movement might be on the horizon. The RSI is at 56.03, indicating a balanced market—neither overbought nor oversold.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Yet, the long-term trend still leans bearish, with the moving averages sloping downward. The recent ""sell the news"" phenomenon, following VELO’s integration with BlackRock’s tokenized fund, saw the price plummet over 22% in just 24 hours. This suggests that while the announcement sparked initial interest, many investors (the short-term) chose to cash in on recent gains.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">To flip the script and signal a bullish reversal, VELO needs to break above the $0.02 level or escape its current consolidation zone.

President Christine Lagarde's latest press conference was a masterclass in ambiguity. While the rate cut was very much on the cards, Lagarde kept the markets guessing with a ""wait-and-see"" game plan. The ECB downgraded its growth forecast to 0.8% for 2024, pointing to softer domestic demand in the upcoming quarters. In other words, the Eurozone is cooling off, and Lagarde isn't rushing to turn up the heat.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Now, here’s the kicker: the ECB's data-dependent mantra means they're not locking in any rate path. This approach is meant to keep options open, but it also leaves traders and investors playing the guessing game. The market’s already priced in a 70% chance that rates will stay put in October. That’s a pretty strong bet that the ECB is going to sit tight, at least for now. But Lagarde's emphasis on flexibility isn't just a buzzword—it's a nod to the unpredictable forces at play: weak exports, geopolitical wildcards, and the delayed impact of previous rate hikes.</span></p><h3 class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">What's Next for the Euro?

Well, Lagarde’s flexible stance signals that any further rate cuts will be gradual and carefully timed. We might see another 25bps trim in December but don’t hold your breath for anything more aggressive this year. It’s clear that the ECB isn’t ready to throw caution to the wind. For the Euro to stage a real comeback, we’ll need more than just a promise of flexibility—we’ll need tangible signs of economic revival. Until then, the Euro’s path forward is fraught with uncertainty, and Lagarde's ""flexible outlook"" may be more of a balancing act than a bold recovery strategy.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-center""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><img src=""https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcPwMnDyTxdHIwEP5EGzqAugbg6Huat-JfdkRPxmJBbpQNNQUzZ0sKtMOvmuDeBE7oF0T1BuZopi96tYi9G9kWZtPcYWi0n8_7alTznMbxeQ19U8c9OykMr7qOiCoHxZtyKAwdacdEad_ncEXJW0gXYzus?key=QjfuGK5BPCbQFq4V-BC04Q"" height=""337""></strong></p><p class=""ql-align-center""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-small"">EXY 4H Chart</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The market's love affair with central bank speeches and rate cuts is as volatile as ever, and Thursday's action was no exception.

This little boost came thanks to ECB President Christine Lagarde's carefully balanced tone, which, while acknowledging the economic slowdown, didn't sound as dovish as some had feared. Suddenly, the Euro looked less like a sinking ship and more like a cautious comeback story. Traders are eyeing the 111.6 level; breaking through that could set the stage for a push towards 112.8, signalling a potential short-term rally for the Euro.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">The Dollar Dilemma: When the Fed Out-Doves the ECB</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Meanwhile, over in dollar land, things are playing out in a way that seems almost counterintuitive. You'd think a rate cut in Europe would make the Euro less attractive, right? But not so fast. The DXY (Dollar Index) continued its downward spiral, slipping past its recent resistance at 101.83 and heading toward the next support at 100.64. The culprit? Market sentiment that the Fed might be even more aggressive in cutting rates compared to the ECB. It's a classic case of, ""Who's the bigger dove?"" and right now, the Fed looks set to win that title. The perception of a faster rate-cutting path in the U.S. is making the dollar lose its shine, nudging the DXY lower.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-center""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><img src=""https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfnK5t_4NFE56-q6nx2X0de8sWcH-RS7vVgFxGyDmQ2vMXNqRCMF0rVdHkEPoszBkJ0swa_ElguqiCRvRf1VXWaw9iDQLHiG4VRdU2Q46bWlfL9wyQJFzEY0AG6dQqyx13xF5dXZFkiEU7437kqhcybFU8?key=QjfuGK5BPCbQFq4V-BC04Q"" height=""337""></span></p><p class=""ql-align-center""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-small"">DXY 4H Chart</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">The Fed vs. ECB: Rate Cuts and Market Moves</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">So, where does this leave us?

The Euro might get some short-term gains if it breaks through those technical levels, but the bigger picture is all about central bank policy direction. The Fed’s perceived eagerness to cut could keep the dollar on the back foot, making every ECB move—no matter how subtle—feel like a potential pivot point.

It kicked off on Monday with a jump from $55k to $58.2k—quite the leap—and stayed in that range for most of the week. The initial surge came on the back of unemployment data that hit expectations, giving the market a nice, warm sense of stability. You know, the kind that makes investors feel all cozy and optimistic.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">‣&nbsp;But then came the mid-week wobble. Bitcoin dipped to $55.5k ahead of a crucial CPI report. Was inflation creeping back in? Turns out, no. CPI came in tame, confirming inflation was under control. Bitcoin wasted no time bouncing back to $58k, in line with the overall ""hey, things are fine"" sentiment rippling through the markets. Thursday added more fuel to this narrative, with the ECB cutting rates, positive PPI data, and unemployment claims slightly above forecast. Still, it was enough to keep the market in a good mood. Despite all this, Bitcoin stayed just shy of $58k, suggesting it’s in a holding pattern, waiting for a nudge in either direction.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">‣&nbsp;What’s been especially interesting this week is Bitcoin’s increasing correlation with the stock market, particularly the S&amp;P 500. On Wednesday, Bitcoin and the S&amp;P were practically moving in sync, as if they were dancing together. If stocks show some bullish volatility on Friday, Bitcoin could break through that stubborn $58.2k resistance. And if it does?

Well, the chatter around rate cuts is getting louder, with both the Eurozone and the U.S. looking for ways to keep the labour market chugging along and avoid an economic slowdown.

So, while we could see Bitcoin continue to dominate in the near term, it’s worth keeping an eye out for any signs of profit-taking.

The recent U.S. CPI data hit the mark at 2.5%, nudging dominance back into its comfort zone. Then, we got the EUR Main Refinancing Rate and U.S. PPI numbers—both on target—which caused a minor slip in BTC dominance but kept it in that tight range. Even U.S. unemployment claims at 230k barely made a dent.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">So, what’s the takeaway here?

If the Fed decides to hold steady in its meeting this Thursday, we might see the market flip to ""risk-on"" mode, with Bitcoin leading the charge. Typically, Bitcoin soaks up capital in bullish markets, pushing its dominance higher. But here’s the twist: when profits start rolling in, investors often rotate into altcoins, pulling Bitcoin’s dominance back down. So, while Bitcoin holds the spotlight for now, keep an eye out for profit-taking.

Not exactly the ideal platform for decentralized finance, right? Enter Layer-2 networks, which have swooped in to help relieve some pressure by offloading traffic. But that’s created a new problem: these Layer-2s are keeping the liquidity to themselves, leaving Ethereum’s main chain feeling a bit neglected.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Cue Based Rollups, a solution that lets Ethereum’s main validators handle those Layer-2 transactions. The idea is that this could ramp up demand for ETH, making it much more integral to the whole system. According to Adam Cochran from Cinneamhain Ventures, this could be a “100x” game-changer for Ethereum. So, is this the fix Ethereum needs to stay on top of the DeFi world? It’s looking pretty promising.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">How important are the Validators?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Ethereum validators, the often-overlooked backbone of the network, might finally get their time in the spotlight thanks to Layer-2 integration. With validators handling Layer-2 transactions, ETH staking becomes more attractive, offering higher rewards and reducing Ethereum’s need to inflate its supply just to pay those staking rewards. This keeps ETH scarce, a win for anyone concerned about token supply. Then there’s the Dencun upgrade that launched in April, briefly putting Ethereum back into inflationary mode. But here’s the twist: Based Rollups could help flip the script by generating more fees, burning more ETH, and bringing back those deflationary vibes everyone loves. Not everyone’s concerned about inflation, though. Ryan Berckmans points out that lower fees can actually boost adoption, making ETH more usable as everyday currency—so, lower fees might not be all bad.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">While Crypto Twitter might be singing the blues about Ethereum’s current state, the truth is the network is arguably in its best shape ever—at least from a technical standpoint.

They're rolling out Gaia v20, and if you're the kind of person who gets excited about Layer 0 protocols—or if you're just clutching onto some ATOM tokens—you might want to pay attention. They've got a draft signaling proposal out, and it's packing three features that could, you know, change everything (or at least make dinner conversation a bit more interesting).

Now, chains can just waltz in by issuing a transaction—no permission slip required—unless they're aiming for the ""Top N"" club, which is still kind of exclusive (because we all need something to aspire to). More chains mean more action, and potentially, more value for those shiny ATOM tokens jingling in your digital pocket.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">ICS with Inactive Validators (Prop 930)</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">In the old days—which, in crypto time, is like two weeks ago—only the ""active"" validators got to be part of the cool kids' table.

It's like the benchwarmers finally getting some playtime, and who knows, maybe they'll score some points.

Yes, I know, it’s the topic that sends eyes rolling faster than you can say “distributed ledger technology,” but stick with me—this might actually be interesting, or at least faster.

Think of the Relay Chain as the main airport hub, and parachains as individual flights trying to avoid delays. Traditionally, parachains produced blocks every 12 seconds, which, in the fast-paced world of crypto, feels like waiting in line at the DMV.

Instead of waiting for the latest Relay Chain block, collators can now build on older blocks. It's like starting dinner even if all the ingredients haven’t arrived yet. The result? Block times drop from 12 seconds to six. That's the blockchain equivalent of moving from dial-up to fiber optic internet—seriously fast.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Teamwork Makes the Blockchain Dream Work</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">What’s cool is that Polkadot didn’t just roll this out alone.

Previously, Polkadot had to overestimate the size of transaction proofs, wasting valuable block space. Now, they’re packing smarter, not harder, making room for more transactions. Combined with Asynchronous Backing, this could boost performance up to 10x. Bigger blocks, produced faster, with more efficient use of space—it’s like upgrading from a sedan to a supercharged SUV.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">What’s Next?

It’s part of Polkadot’s broader plan for Polkadot 2.0, which includes even more flexibility and scalability with features like Agile Coretime and Elastic Scaling. These upgrades are crucial for high-throughput applications, like blockchain-based games where every sword swing or trade is a transaction.

Thanks to Referendum 1129, the network boosted its validator count from a modest 297 to a bustling 400, and that’s not even the end goal. They’re aiming for 1,000 validators by next year. It’s like upgrading to a bigger venue and sending out even more invites.

Great news, but let’s break it down. The Nakamoto Coefficient measures decentralisation, telling you how many validators it would take to control over a third of the network's stake. So, in Polkadot’s case, 112 validators would need to team up to do anything sketchy. More decentralisation equals better security, so this jump is definitely a win.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Does More Validators Mean Better Security?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The whole idea behind increasing validators is to strengthen decentralisation. Think of it like adding extra layers of security to a concert—more guards, fewer chances of trouble. But then there’s the age-old question: Can you have too much of a good thing? Eventually, adding more validators might feel like overcrowding the kitchen with too many chefs.

Yes, that’s the actual name. It means that all validators have equal voting power, regardless of how much stake they hold. So, it’s like a democracy where everyone’s vote counts the same, whether you're a crypto whale or just getting started. Add in the Phragmen election algorithm (say that five times fast), and Polkadot makes sure everything is balanced and fair. Validators shuffle in and out of the active set every 24 hours. It’s like a blockchain version of musical chairs, but with way more maths.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Scaling Validators Without Breaking the Chain</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Polkadot’s goal of scaling up to 1,000 validators isn’t just about showing off. More validators mean the network can process more transactions, opening the door for more projects to join. But here’s the tricky part: scaling up without losing quality. It’s like expanding a restaurant chain—you want more locations, but you don’t want the food to taste worse.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">What’s the Deal With ChainflowPOS?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Polkadot’s high decentralisation score comes from ChainflowPOS, an independent team that tracks validator decentralisation across networks. Basically, they’re like the auditors of the blockchain world.

Lower rates mean cheaper borrowing, which typically floods the market with more liquidity and a higher appetite for risk, setting the perfect stage for Bitcoin and its blockchain buddies to strut their stuff.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Think of it as the Fed turning down the interest rate thermostat, making traditional savings as appealing as a soggy sandwich, and nudging investors toward the shiny, unpredictable world of crypto in search of those elusive higher returns. Plus, if inflation decides to throw a tantrum later, Bitcoin might just don its superhero cape as the decentralised hedge against a weakening dollar. So, while the Fed fiddles with rates like a DJ at a party, crypto markets are ready to remix the financial playlist—grab your digital snacks, because this track could get wild.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">What Just Happened?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Think of the Fed’s rate-cutting decisions as the central bank playing with the economic thermostat. When they cut rates, it’s usually to keep the economy from overheating or to fend off a chill. And yesterday, they cranked the dial down by half a percent. Fed Chair Jerome Powell framed it as a way to “maintain strength in the labour market while moderating growth and pushing inflation down to 2%.” Translation: keep things humming without letting inflation run wild.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The Big Cut: Are They Fixing a Mistake?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">A 50 basis point cut isn’t just a tweak—it’s a statement. Some economists, like Michael Feroli at JP Morgan, are clapping for the Fed, saying it was about time they got serious about bringing rates down to a “neutral” level of around 3%. But others? They see it as an admission of error, a sign that the Fed may have overcooked previous rate hikes. Are we watching the Fed correct its course, or are they just trying to steer the ship away from the choppy waters they created?</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">A Blast from the Past</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Before we get swept up in the market’s excitement over the Fed’s hefty rate cut, let’s take a quick trip down memory lane. In 2007, the Fed kicked off a rate-cut cycle with the S&amp;P 500 near its peak, and while stocks celebrated briefly, they soon tumbled, with the S&amp;P ultimately losing 57%.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The last time we saw a cut this big was March 2008, amid the Great Recession. Markets initially cheered, but it didn’t take long for things to unravel. Even in 2020, when the pandemic hit, big rate cuts eventually helped the market rebound—but only after a sharp and painful crash. So, are we heading for a rerun? Stocks are flying high, bond yields are plummeting, and gold is glittering, but seasoned investors might advise holding off on popping the champagne—this party could be short-lived.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Fed Chair Powell: Confident or Just Hopeful?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Fed Chair Jerome Powell reassured us that this move reflects “growing confidence” in maintaining a strong labour market and taming inflation. In other words, he thinks they can pull off the balancing act of cooling inflation without crashing the economy. It’s the central bank version of patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The Crypto Angle</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">For crypto investors, lower rates could boost interest in riskier assets like Bitcoin.

While stocks partied, the U.S. dollar decided to take a nap, with the Dollar Index (DXY) falling 0.56% to its lowest level since July 2023, hitting 100.21. So, what’s really going on here, and why does this matter for the U.S. economy? Let’s break it down.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">The Dollar Takes a Hit</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">As soon as the Fed announced the rate cut, the dollar faced serious selling pressure. The DXY dropped to 100.21 before regaining some ground to close at 100.68. Still, the broader trend suggests a weaker dollar on the horizon. Barclays’ forex strategist Lefteris Farmakis summed it up nicely: “The Fed’s decision was quite dovish, which bodes well with a rebound in risk and further near-term U.S. dollar weakness.”</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Why Is the Dollar Sliding?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">When the Fed cuts rates, the yield on U.S. assets decreases, making them less attractive to foreign investors. So, naturally, they start looking for higher returns elsewhere, leading to a sell-off in the dollar. Add in the fact that lower rates often boost risk appetite—encouraging investors to ditch the dollar for riskier bets like stocks or emerging markets—and you’ve got a recipe for a weaker greenback.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">What This Means for the Economy</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">A weaker dollar can be a mixed bag for the U.S. economy. On the upside, it makes American exports cheaper and more competitive globally. This could be a boon for the manufacturing sector. But on the downside, a weak dollar makes imports pricier, which can drive up inflation. That means higher costs for everyday goods like electronics and clothing, which could put a squeeze on consumer spending.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">The Fed’s Messaging: Dovish but Not Panicky</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Leading up to the Fed meeting, there was speculation over whether the cut would be 25 or 50 basis points. The Fed went bigger, signalling a proactive stance to keep the economy on track. Chair Jerome Powell tried to reassure everyone, saying, “We do not see any indication of a recession or even an economic downturn ahead.” But the market’s reaction suggests some underlying nerves.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Already Seen or Something New?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">This isn’t the first time we’ve seen the dollar take a hit after a big Fed cut.

The flagship cryptocurrency surged to a three-week high, breaking past $63,000 during the Asia trading session. But is this the start of a sustained rally, or are we seeing a familiar pattern from past Fed cuts?

Sure, some market players were leaning towards it, but most economists had been betting on a more modest 25 bps cut. By going large, the Fed is signalling it’s serious about keeping economic growth on track while managing inflation.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Bitcoin’s Surge: Why Did It Jump?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">As soon as the Fed’s announcement dropped, Bitcoin jumped 3.5%, crossing the $63,000 mark. That’s a solid 24-hour gain, with the broader crypto market also enjoying a 4.48% lift. It seems investors are viewing Bitcoin as a solid “risk-on” asset in this low-interest-rate environment. When borrowing becomes cheaper, traditional investments lose their lustre, and riskier assets like Bitcoin look more attractive. Even crypto-related stocks like Coinbase and MicroStrategy got in on the action, seeing their shares climb by 4% and 5%, respectively.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Is This a Repeat of 2020?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The last time we saw a cut of this magnitude was back in March 2020, as the pandemic was turning the world upside down. Back then, Bitcoin initially tanked but soon rebounded in a spectacular fashion, hitting new all-time highs by year’s end. The surge was fueled by institutional adoption and a broader shift toward viewing Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty. So, is this rally following the same script?</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Well, not quite. Unlike 2020, this cut doesn’t come amid a full-blown crisis, but rather as a proactive move to keep the economy stable.

The S&amp;P 500 surged after the Fed cut rates in 2007, but that rally was short-lived, with the market eventually tumbling 57%.

Why? Simple: lower rates mean cheaper borrowing, fewer returns on safe assets, and suddenly riskier bets—like crypto—start looking a lot more attractive. With liquidity pouring in, investors chasing yield see Ethereum not just as digital magic money but as a real opportunity. So, in the strange new world of finance, when the Fed sneezes, Ethereum catches a bid.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong class=""ql-size-large"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Ethereum’s Rally: Riding the Fed Wave</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Ethereum clearly liked what it heard. After the Fed’s announcement, Ethereum surged to $2,437, marking a 4.8% bump. Investors suddenly seemed very interested in the second-largest cryptocurrency. In a world where low-yield investments are looking less and less attractive, Ethereum’s promise of higher returns starts looking pretty good.

Not bad for a day's work.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Of course, it’s not like Ethereum’s been without challenges. Decentralized app (DApp) volume is down 19%, but apparently that didn’t matter much in the face of all this liquidity flooding the market.

In March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, the Fed slashed rates by a similar 50 basis points. Ethereum took a hit at first, as markets panicked, but it didn’t take long for things to turn around.

Enter Ethereum.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">But it’s not just about chasing returns. Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is also seen as a hedge against inflation.

Bitcoin dominance has been in a strong uptrend since late February, bouncing off the 52.1% support level, which was like its ""get-up-and-go"" moment. Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself has been stuck in a downtrend, but that’s not stopping BTC.D from charging ahead. Recently, it even broke past the 57.26% resistance level, right after the Fed decided to cut bond rates by 50 basis points.

Well, if the macroeconomy keeps sending good vibes, we could see BTC.D heading toward the 60% mark.

If you’re wondering why Fibonacci matters, let’s just say that traders love it because it tells them where prices might turn. Once Bitcoin Dominance hit that floor, it found a way to continue its upward climb, using the lower edge of an ascending channel that it's been stuck in since February.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself has been stuck in a downtrend, but that’s not stopping BTC.D from charging ahead. Recently, it even broke past the 57.26% resistance level, right after the Fed decided to cut bond rates by 50 basis points. And let’s not forget Powell’s speech, where he practically sang a dovish tune.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">So, what does this mean for Bitcoin’s dominance? Well, if the macroeconomy keeps sending good vibes, we could see BTC.D heading toward the 60% mark. Historically, this happens because traders take profits in Bitcoin first—being the king of crypto—and then shift their capital into altcoins, which usually rally after the big guy takes the lead.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Why is the 52% level important?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Now, let’s dive into the technicals. The 52% level? It’s not just any random number. This spot has historically been a strong support for BTC.D, and it also lines up with the 0.38 Fibonacci level from the last peak at 73.6%. If you’re wondering why Fibonacci matters, let’s just say that traders love it because it tells them where prices might turn. Once Bitcoin Dominance hit that floor, it found a way to continue its upward climb, using the lower edge of an ascending channel that it's been stuck in since February. Think of it as Bitcoin Dominance riding the escalator of crypto market supremacy.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">How does the macroeconomy factor in?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">So, where does all of this leave us? Well, if you take the equation: </span><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Fed rate cut + Dovish speech = Risk On</strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">, you get a clear picture. Bitcoin Dominance is rising because, let’s face it, Bitcoin is the safest bet in the crypto world, like the ‘blue chip’ of the digital currency world. If the total crypto market cap holds, we could see Bitcoin and BTC.D continue their climb. But—and this is where it gets interesting—when Bitcoin starts hitting those key resistance levels, traders will likely take profits. That’s when we’ll see a portfolio rotation into riskier, more speculative altcoins.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The result? Altcoins rally, and Bitcoin Dominance could retreat below that 52% support level. It’s a classic cycle: first Bitcoin wins, then the altcoins get their turn.</span></p>","2024-09-19 20:02:35.406935",1,"Bitcoin","2024-09-19 19:02:35.407088+00",NULL

In the short term, the index has some immediate support to watch. First up is that previous all-time high, and then we’ve got the $5300 level, which was where the market settled after the August 1st unemployment claims report. That report caused a bit of a panic—pushing prices down across the board.

Once you break an all-time high, it’s kind of like sailing into unknown waters. But let’s bring some order to the chaos. By plotting a Fibonacci retracement (yes, the magic lines that traders love), we can estimate that the next resistance levels could be around $5824 to $6000. If the index pushes through that, we’re looking at targets between $6500 and $6950. It’s like a video game—hit a level, break the level, and move to the next.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Of course, if things go south and the main support at $5638 gives way, we could be heading back down to the $5300-$5100 zone.

That’s good news for both the S&amp;P500 and Bitcoin.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">But don’t just focus on weekly reports. The real action will come from the monthly unemployment rate. This number will be key in determining how fast the Fed cuts rates in the months ahead.

Well, buckle up.</span></p>","2024-09-19 20:13:55.86484",1,"Bitcoin","2024-09-19 19:13:55.864961+00",NULL

It’s almost like Bitcoin’s saying, “I’ve had my fun, now it's your turn.” So if BTC.D continues to rise, don’t be surprised if an altcoin rally is just around the corner.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"" class=""ql-size-large"">Is Bitcoin Dominance About to Cool Off?</strong></p><p class=""ql-align-center""><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><img src=""https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeIHKpJ0Nl3qEOGv2yzJtRCDIo4Ubdf9Sfgx2350MC7JRlWl3ri3LrKfYLE4SqHRbd_HKdyBQyo9JNFl9w3A6yH_q7TBpXF4UwwccusyxHaDQKE9G6a21V1gEEQ8ukkOqI2ooEeDZlCDwZ9my0K3FSKpN_5?key=Js9ri40BE-36XNMx6fUTWQ"" height=""280""></strong></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Bitcoin dominance has been riding an upward wave for months, recently breaking through key resistance and sparking bullish momentum. Right now, it’s holding steady above 57.03% support, with its eye on 60% resistance, and even a target of 63% if things keep heating up. The Fed’s surprise 0.5% rate hike on September 18 played a major role, pushing BTC.D to 58.6%, though it cooled off a bit later.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The indicators are looking strong—dominance is sitting above key moving averages—but with the RSI edging into overbought territory, we might see some consolidation or a minor pullback.

It’s been stuck in a descending channel for a while, marking its bearish trend. Currently priced around $63,535, Bitcoin is flirting with the upper boundary of this channel, sitting less than 10% away from key support. The 20-week moving average (in red) is critical right now—Bitcoin is testing it as support, and a breakout above could signal a bullish run.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The long-term picture looks stable, with the 100-week moving average (in purple) far below as strong support that hasn't been tested yet. Volume is picking up, especially on bullish candles, indicating that buyers might be accumulating. With the RSI hovering around 50, Bitcoin’s next move could go either way. A breakout, confirmed by rising volume and RSI pushing above 60, would suggest a bullish reversal. But if momentum fades, further consolidation or a retest of lower levels might be ahead.</span></p><p class=""ql-align-justify""><em style=""color: rgb(29, 28, 29);"">AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice.</em></p><p><br></p>","2024-09-23 15:18:16.256196",1,"Bitcoin","2024-09-23 14:18:16.25641+00",NULL
