AmongLayer 0protocols,Polkadot(DOT) has thehighest market cap at 15.84 billion, followed byCosmos(ATOM)at $5.51 billionand lastlyQuant(QNT)at $1.69 billion.BothPolkadot(DOT) andQuant(QNT) have experienced notable price increases, with DOTrisingby12.40%andQNTby10.05%. This percentage increase surpasses that of Bitcoin (BTC), which saw a rise of 9.10%.ETHis showing a potential slowing of the upward price momentum. The significant drop in average transaction fees across Ethereum layer-2 (L2) networks following the implementation of Dencun, the latest upgrade to the Ethereum network, could be a contributing factor to Ethereum's decrease in 7-day percentage. Lower transaction fees on layer-2 solutions alleviate the burden of high gas costs for users, potentially leading to increased network usage and transaction volume. This enhanced scalability and improved user experience on Ethereum's layer-2 networks may have potentially driven increased adoption and market sentiment for Layer 0s.The increase inATOM'smarket capitalization and the small increase in its price may be attributed to the approval of a proposal to reduce the maximum inflation rate of ATOM from 14% to 10% annually. This change could potentially lead to a decrease in the new token supply, fostering scarcity and potentially driving up demand. However, if the reduction in inflation adversely affects validators' incentives, it could impact network security and investor confidence negatively. Furthermore, the rise in market cap could be influenced by Grayscale's launch of a staking product for cryptocurrencies, including ATOM. Grayscale's involvement typically attracts institutional investors and may contribute to increased demand for ATOM. Additionally, the staking product may result in more ATOM being locked in staking contracts, thereby reducing circulating supply.DOT\u2019smarket cap and price have noticed an increase. The combination of the Alpha Program launch and the token burning from the treasury appears to have positively impacted the DOT token. The Alpha Program strengthens community engagement and development, while the token burning contributes to potential scarcity and a deflationary narrative. The market's positive response, reflected in the increase in market cap and token price, indicates that these initiatives are well-received by the cryptocurrency community.QNThas demonstrated a more substantial price increase compared to Bitcoin, suggesting a potentially significant uptrend worth monitoring. Notably, this occurred in the same week when BTC achieved a new all-time high (ATH). The magnitude of QNT's growth surpassing that of BTC on such a week could signify a particularly impactful surge for Quant, warranting attention for its potential market dynamics and growth trajectory.DOT has demonstrated a notable surge in market capitalization and a robust positive 7-day change, indicating strong demand and bullish sentiment. Conversely, QNT has witnessed a positive 7-day change despite experiencing a slight decrease in market cap, implying potential fluctuations in capitalization. Meanwhile, Cosmos has seen a moderate rise in market cap and a slight positive 7-day change suggesting steady growth for the ATOM token."}]}

After retesting this 118 price zone, it made a rebound and is actually 14% up from that point (reaching $135).This $118 price zone is the 0.23 Fibonacci level traced from November 2022 high ($229), and since it was sustained, the price (if BTC correction doesn't go further) could head to the 0.38 Fibonacci level at $150.Future Perspectives:Possible short-term targets for QNT could be (if, as said, BTC correction doesn't go further) $150, $153.8, $162.5 and $173.5. This would mean its price reached the 0.61 Fibonacci level from November 2022 high.The most critical area right now would be the $133.4 - $142.6 price zone, since this is the reversion zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from the last 2024 high of $153.8. If this price zone is surpassed, then the price should head to $150 - $153.8 - $163.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesPolkadot (DOT)]:Polkadot had a good week in price development and market cap growth, besides its Alpha program launch which continues to strengthen its ecosystem, but did not perform as well as QNT did, in part because of its specific weight in the Market Cap.Cosmos (ATOM):ATOM had a sideways market week, while being announced that it would be included in the new staking fund by Grayscale.

In contrast, other projects have experienced significant price declines during the same period.Cardano (ADA) saw the most substantial decrease, plummeting by 20%, while Ethereum (ETH) followed closely behind with a 19% drop.Notably,ADA and ETH have exhibited a consistent pattern of price movement, with their percentages of decrease remaining similar throughout this period.In recent weeks, SOL has witnessed significant developments and market dynamics that have influenced its impressive increase in price. Firstly, the surge in newSOL addresses, with over 700,000 registered in a week, signals growing interest and adoptionwithin the Solana ecosystem. Additionally, thecreation of new SPL tokens on the Solana networkhas reached historic highs, averaging over 7,800 tokens daily, further indicatingincreased activity and developmentwithin the ecosystem. Despite a slight pullback from its all-time high, SOL's price has remained resilient, supported by strong market demand driven by factors such as thenotable rally of Dogwifhat (WIF) and other memecoins on the Solana network. However, amid the meme coin craze,the protocol encountered challenges, as seen with the accidental burning of $10 million worth of pre-sale tokens for the Slerf memecoin.WhileADA saw the biggest decreasein contrast to other Layer 1 protocols, theintroduction of the USDM stablecoin on Cardano marks a significant milestone in the blockchain's evolution, potentially enhancing its utility and appeal within the DeFi space. Stablecoins play a vital role in facilitating various financial transactions, providing stability and liquidity to users within the ecosystem. However, the impact of stablecoin launches on ADA's price may not be immediately reflected in short-term market movements. Additionally, theanticipation surrounding the Chang Hardfork and Plutus V3 upgrade presents a forward-looking perspective for Cardano's future capabilities, potentially attracting more users and developers to the platform.Avalanche (AVAX)has showcased considerable volatility, witnessingfluctuations in its priceover the past week. However, the recent announcement regarding thecollaboration between Nexon Group and Ava Labs to introduce the renowned game MapleStory onto the Avalanche network highlights the platform's growing adoption and expansioninto new use cases beyond traditional finance. This move to integrate a popular game onto the Web3 platform of Avalanche introduces anew avenue for user engagement and potential token utility, potentially attracting more users and driving further demand for AVAX.Layer 1 protocols exhibited mixed performanceover the period. Solana recorded a price increase despite a decrease in market capitalization, contrasting with AVAX and ADA, which experienced declines in both metrics."}]}

A classic inverted \u201chead and shoulders\u201d pattern takes shape with BTC crafting its right shoulder.Technical Analysis Insights:Bitcoin's dominance (BTC.D) confirms a healthy pullback at the moment, as it stays above the bullish side of the Darvas box. It can be found the strongest resistance at the $2300 price level as this has been attempted to break multiple times. However, it seems, that the said price levels are strong enough to resist.Bitcoin is on the critical higher-low structure as it sits above $61,000 levels.

Their existence is conditional on the crypto trilemma: scalability, security and decentralisation.Strategies to tackle the core issue of Layer 1 blockchains are; scalability, including changing consensus protocols (as in the case of ETH with the move from PoW to PoS), sharding and other innovative solutions focused on increasing the capacity and speed of transactions.Featured Cryptocurrency of the Week: AVAXThis Week's Breakthroughs:A fundamental point underlying the strength in AVAX price action may be that over 70% of AVAX holders are in profit and that many positions are being held in anticipation of reaching higher targets, demonstrating the clear confidence that the market is placing in the ecosystem.Regardless of the correction Bitcoin is having this week (it is currently down -15% from its ATH reached on March 14), AVAX remained much stronger than its competitors ADA and SOL, posting a drop of only 9% during the week of March 18-22 (updated at 11 am UTC-3 ).Technical AnalysisRecent Price Movements:AVAX had a 56% bull run approximately this past few weeks and has retested several times the $50 price zone, which has been established as a strong resistance so far.In addition, between $46.6 and $41.5 we have another strong resistance for the price as here we find the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels from the last low at $34.83), an area that the price should respect to the upside if looking for a long trade.Future Perspectives:The AVAX price is approaching the $54 mark (corresponding to its 0.23 Fibonacci level from the 2024 peak), with the potential to dip into the $50 zone. This area is considered prime for initiating long positions, having established itself as a formidable resistance and possibly becoming a new medium-term foundation to spur an upward trend for AVAX.Given that AVAX has revisited the $58 zone twice this week and is currently moving below its 0.23 Fibonacci level ($54) from 2024 high, the forthcoming targets are anticipated to be $52.3, followed by $50.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesCardano (ADA):At the end of last week, ADA was in the news because a billionaire investor and ADA holder had announced his entry into the DeFi world via an AI-driven token, O2T. But it seems that Bitcoin's decline has also dampened the expectation that this development on the Cardano network will be a success.Solana (SOL):The launch of several meme coins based on Solana and the increasing interest in this network because of its speed and growing DeFi ecosystem was not enough to keep SOL's price this week above its layer 1 competitors. Not even the popularity gained by BONK, its first meme coin, could keep up the demand for the network's native token, which fell 16% this week."}]}

This initiative not only enhances the ecosystem\u00b4s capabilities but also contributes to an upward trajectory in the token\u00b4s valuation.This move aligns with Algorand Ventures' strategic investment in Folks Finance, a platform facilitating digital asset lending, borrowing, and trading, fostering cross-chain growth in tandem with the token's ascent, which also achieved a remarkable milestone by amassing a total value locked in (TVL) of $170 million by the close of 2023. This milestone underscores the platform's significant role and promising prospects for those seeking to engage with dynamic and innovative financial opportunities in the blockchain sector.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsALGO had a 265% bull run from October 2023, reached its reversion zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from November 2022 High, and afterwards it made a pullback of approximately 32% to the 0.38 Fibonacci level price zone ($0.22) which also coincides with the reversion zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from the last low (January 23rd) to the last High of 2024.For ALGO's value to persist on its ascending trajectory, it's crucial that its market valuation maintains the support level at the $0.22 price point. This would give it a chance to generate a rebound to its reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels from its November 2022 High) at $0.31-$0.37, which if broken to the upside could take the price to values close to $0.5.Even with a 2.6X rise since October, ALGO remains significantly distant from surpassing the above $1 mark, a value it held during the 2021 bull run.Since ALGO's circulating supply is above 98%, a large injection of liquidity into the project will be necessary to bring its price back to near $1, but it was demonstrated in 2021 that this is possible, when its total market cap remained above $12 billion.Short-Term Price TargetsFor ALGO to continue its upward path, the $0.22-$0.187 zone must be respected to the upside, and the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) of its last lowest high reached on March 26th must be broken to the upside, i.e. above the $0.275 price zone.A good entry point to attempt a long trade would be the price zone between $0.28 and $0.294.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

The stablecoin, initially to be issued on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchain, will follow a 1:1 ratio with the U.S. dollar and be backed by a combination of U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. government Treasuries, and other cash equivalents.Ripple emphasizes its commitment to compliance, with plans for third-party audits and monthly attestations to ensure transparency and credibility. Leveraging its reputation, experience, and robust balance sheet, also aims to establish itself as a prominent player in the evolving stablecoin landscape, anticipating significant growth potential in the market.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsXRP price action has been describing an ascending channel since the last quarter of 2022 (marked in yellow in the image below). During July 2023, its price action made a peak of +99% when Ripple had a favourable ruling in its litigation against the SEC.But after that sharp rise, XRP price action returned to its pre-judgment price zone. Since that time, the XRP price has had two 52%-58% rallies up to test its reversal zone (the 0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels from its last high of 2023) to the $0.74 price zone and has rejected it to the downside both times. This is why this price zone has constituted a strong resistance to the XRP price breakthrough.Currently, the XRP price is at the bottom of the mentioned ascending channel, an area that should be sustained to the upside to continue with further rises. Coincidentally, this lower edge is in the price zone of the 0.23 Fibonacci level from its July 2023 high (i.e. $0.545) and the 0.38 Fibonacci level traced from its March 2022 high to its 2022 low (i.e. $0.534).The last zone to which the XRP price could fall would be $0.49, where the 0.13 Fibonacci level from its July 2023 high is located.Short-Term Price TargetsThe ideal area to attempt a long trade would be to wait for the price to touch and hold the lower margin of the descending channel ($0.53 - $0.54 price zone), and then make a bullish entry at $0.55, looking for a bounce to the upper area of the descending channel where it will again face the $0.74-$0.826 reversal zone. If that reversal zone is breached, then the price is more likely to reach its 2023 high and even break through it.If the price does not reach the $0.55 area, then an entry could be sought at the $0.63 area, where the 0.38 Fibonacci level from its July 2023 high would be broken to the upside.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

This implies a continued bullish outlook, with uncertainty remaining over which MA will be respected in the future. Normally, over a very bullish scenario like this, BTC might potentially respect MA20, the closest moving average to its current price. Lastly, BTC has been forming the typical breakout pattern with a sequence of candle formations:\u00a0 the breakout candle (breaks above the past ATH price) > confirmation candle(retesting the past ATH price) > validation (this week\u2019s candle should make another upward movement).Technical analysis on a 1 day timeframeAs BTC stayed above $69,000, a subdued market could emerge over the coming days, potentially consolidating above the plotted green line($68,500 - $70,500) or a broader range between $69,000 - $74,000 price levels may develop.

At that time, the Bitcoin network rewards through the Proof of Work (PoW) mining system are cut in half, generating at the same time a sharp reduction in the Bitcoin supply growth rate and feelings of scarcity in the market, which are historically accompanied by strong price increases.Tech InsightsThe halving of BTC would have various consequences for the crypto ecosystem:-First, the growth rate in Bitcoin's total supply is cut in half as stated in its core protocol (mining rewards are reduced to 3.125 BTC per block), which reconfirms that it is a scarce and deflationary asset, unlike FIAT currencies that are issued according to the monetary policies of each regulatory authority.-Second, this reinforces the market sentiment that cryptocurrencies are assets with solid foundations and a long-term project designed not only for financial speculation but as an ecosystem of diverse applications and a new paradigm for asset management.-Finally, Bitcoin reinforces its position as the most dominant crypto asset in market capitalisation and consistently follows a narrative, without changing the precepts on which it was founded.Market Dynamics-After the first Halving, Bitcoin went from $13 to $652, a rise of 4,802%, but although subsequent halvings have produced smaller percentage increases, the last one in 2020 catapulted the price of BTC by almost 700%.-However, major market players such as CEOs of mining companies, anticipate investments for their installed mining capacity as they predict future increases in the price of the asset, mainly because this time there is greater presence and interest from institutional investors due to the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs.-Given the rapid recovery of Bitcoin's price after posting an 18% correction following its ATH and the proximity to Halving, we could see a more likely upward move beyond the ATH and take the price to new highs.Market Projections and Technical OutlookBTC/USDT 1D Chart-BTC price has crossed the reversion zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from its ATH, i.e. the $68,750 - $71,030 zone, which could lead the price to touch 1.27-1.61, i.e. above its ATH to the $73,700 - $76,300 price zone.-As long as the price action respects and sustains the $71,000 level, then we could see Bitcoin break its ATH with a higher level of probability.-Another important point for Bitcoin after breaking the $69,000 ATH is the 83400 area, where the 1.27 Fibonacci level is located and the price usually heads statistically after breaking the reversal zone.-If the price action were to reach or surpass this level and remain between $83,400 and $102,000 (1.61 Fibonacci level from its 2021 ATH), existing long trades should take partial profits as the market would be subject to high volatility, with frequent sweeps and high possibility of correction."}]}

It remains to be seen whether Bitcoin's apparent recovery will cause more capital to flow into the Arbitrum ecosystem, generating a rise in the price of ARB.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsArbitrum has rebounded 212% since October 2023, achieving a new ATH and breaking its previous high that had been in place since April 2023.After registering this new high, its price action had a 43% correction back to its reversal zone (0.61-0.78 levels) of the Fibonacci retracement plotted from its last low to its ATH.Currently, its price is inside the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from its High 1, which should be broken to the upside as a sign of bullish strength.Breaching the $1.6 price zone would mean breaking back through the reversal zone from High 1 and re-approaching the ATH. This would also mean forming a higher high and possibly a higher low, breaking the short-term downtrend that had formed.Short-Term Price TargetsThinking on the long side, the $1.6 area should be breached to the upside, leaving a good entry point at $1.64 (with a lower confirmation level and probability of success).For a long trade with higher confirmation and probability of success, the $1.82 price zone should be expected, i.e., once the last high's area has been breached.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

POL aims to revolutionise multi-chain staking and token design by extending the ecosystem to interconnected Layer 2 solutions. While promising benefits without the risks of re-staking, this new token raises questions about the role of existing MATIC protocol rewards.At the core of POL's design is \"enshrined re-staking\", which enables re-staking across multiple chains to maximise rewards and minimise reliance on trusted third parties, reducing centralisation. Representing a new era in token design, POL sets a standard as a hyper-productive asset, propelling Polygon into a more interconnected and secure future.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsPOL's price action has been describing an ascending channel (higher lows and higher highs) since October 2023 as drawn in the picture below.Since each impulse following the ascending channel triggers a new high, it could be expected with a good probability of occurrence that as the price is in the lower range of the ascending channel, its price will rebound towards the upper range.However, it must respect the ascending channel for the price to continue its upward path.Currently, the price action is at a key point, where the Market Maker will try to use his trap to make the retailer believe that the price will break the channel to the downside, liquidating the long positions and then possibly bounce to the upside.Short-Term Price TargetsIn this context close to the lower margin of the channel it would be logical to look for a long position as there is a higher probability of success.

In addition to staking rewards, users can leverage these stAssets in other DeFi applications as collateral for loans or yield farming.Lido, launched in 2020, is a pioneer in liquid staking, supporting multiple PoS blockchains such as Ethereum, Polygon, Kusama, Solana, and Polkadot. Lido's protocol ensures stakeholder alignment, transparency, and decentralization through its native token, LDO, which grants voting rights in proportion to the holder's stake, and through its DAO government.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsLDO's price action reached a new ATH in January 2024 after posting a +170% rise since October 2023. Following its ATH, it has fallen approximately 63% and is currently in the $1.96 price zone.Despite LDO's last sweep on April 13, the price formed a higher low than the last low of August 2023. Because of this and the new ATH reached in January, the long term trend remains upward, with higher lows and higher highs.For the uptrend to continue as a limit point the price must not break the August 2023 low downwards, otherwise it could visit $0.95 and then $0.7.Ideally, to take advantage of an eventual rise, the price action should respect the reversal zone (0.61- 0.78 Fibonacci levels) from its last low of August 2023.Short-Term Price TargetsIn this short-term bearish context, Bitcoin's evolution should be closely monitored for a bullish continuation (continue above the 60k level). Should this occur, and should LDO reject the 0.78 Fibonacci level upwards from its August 2023 low, two entries could be made:-The first one, is riskier and less likely to succeed at $2.11, once the price recovers the 0.23 Fibonacci level from its ATH and \u00a0having respected the 0.78 level mentioned above.-The second with a higher confirmation level and probability of success at $2.47, once the reversal zone from the August 2023 low is rejected to the upside and the 0.38 Fibonacci level from the ATH is broken.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

Staking ETH via Rocket Pool through Ledger Live provides rETH tokens, whose value depends on a dynamic exchange rate.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsRPL has surged about 130% from its October 2023 low to its peak in 2024. Following this peak, it experienced a pullback, revisited the high of 2024 forming a double top, and subsequently retracted by 50% to the present price of around $19.9.Furthermore, the price has just broken down the 1.27 Fibonacci level (at $21.5) traced from its first low to its ATH, and the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from its lowest low, both signals that in the short term would be bearish.Currently, it's crucial to highlight that RPL's price is approaching its historical low. For swing traders, this could represent an optimal buying opportunity, suggesting significant potential for future gains.In the short term to continue higher, RPL should recover $21.5 and then rally back up to $26 and sustain this price zone to the upside, which would mean that the reversal zone from the lower low was rejected, this being a bullish signal.The ideal long entry would be after $26 is broken to the upside.Short-Term Price TargetsGiven the current short-term downtrend that RPL is in, patience will be required to look for long entries, and two zones could be considered to take advantage of a price recovery:-The first would be $26.5, meaning that the reversal zone was rejected and a first short-term bullish signal.-The second would be at $35 with a higher level of confirmation and probability of success, this price zone being higher than the reversal zone from the 2024 high.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

However,LSDs have experienced this downturn in a more pronounced manner, emphasising the heightened impact on this sector.Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a significant decrease in market valueover the past week, with itsprice droppingby approximately13.71%. This decline can be attributed to several factors, includingbroader market sentiment influenced by negative price movements in Bitcoin (BTC), which serves as a benchmark for the entire cryptocurrency market. Additionally,concerns about high inflation rates and regulatory uncertainties, such as the ongoingSEC investigationinto the Ethereum Foundation and the potentialclassification of Ether as a security, have likely contributed to investor apprehension and selling pressure.Thesignificant decreasein the price ofLido (LDO) by 24.69%can be attributed to several factors, primarily concerning thegrowing withdrawals of ETH from the Lido protocol.Lido's market sharein the Ethereum liquid staking market has reached nearly30%, indicating itsdominancein this sector.

This decline suggests potential challenges or shifts in investor sentiment towards FXS.Thesignificant decreasein the market price, price and TVL ofLido (LDO)can be attributed to several interconnected factors. Firstly, thegrowing withdrawals of Ethereum from the Lido protocoldirectly impacted the TVL as investors pulled out their assets, leading to a reduction in LDO's value. Additionally,concernswithin the Ethereum communityregarding Lido's dominancein the liquid staking market, coupled with worries aboutcentralization risks and security measureslike slashing, likely influenced investor sentiment, contributing to the decline in LDO's market price.

Furthermore, theintroduction of ETFs may attract new investors to the market, potentially increasing participation in staking activities and liquidity provision, which could positively impact RPL's TVL.However, the emergence of ETFs could also introduce competition for investment capital, potentially diverting funds away from direct investments in RPL and exerting downward pressure on its priceif demand wanes.The news surrounding apotential SEC determination classifying Ethereum (ETH) as a security could have significant implications for Frax Finance (FXS), particularly due to its recent price decrease and TVL fall. If the SEC were to classify ETH as a security, it couldtrigger a cascade effect across the cryptocurrency market, potentially leading to increased regulatory scrutiny and compliance requirements for projects like Frax Finance. Thisheightened regulatory environment could dampen investor sentiment and confidence in FXS, leading to a decrease in its price as investors become wary of potential regulatory challenges and uncertainties. Additionally, themarket reaction to the news of Bitcoin and Ethereum's further decline following the release of US inflation data suggests increased market volatility and risk aversion, which could further contribute to downward pressure on FXS's price.

The price is also reacting to earlier consolidation ranges, between $2.00 and $2.50, seen prior to the 2024 rally. This recent consolidation could indicate a halt to the downtrend, although a definitive breakout is necessary to confirm a change in trend direction.What's Behind the Price Drop?-BTC\u2019s correction correlated to BTCDom\u2019s breakout:As BTC experienced a decline, BTCDOM made a significant move by breaking out to its multi-year high resistance, confirming a potential liquidation event for the entire market. Therefore, when Bitcoin experiences declines, the rest of the market typically follows suit with declines ranging from three to four times greater, owing to its liquidity.-The MA100 breakdown:The initial breakdown occurred in the middle of March when the price fell below the MA100. Despite this, OP's didn't experience a decline immediately as it attempted to recover and the price temporarily rose to $4.00. However, this recovery proved to be unsustainable, and the price began to fall again, dropping from $4.039 to $1.80 within a two-week period.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeThe latest price activity of Optimism suggests that the downtrend may have reached its end.After experiencing a consecutive five-week decline, Optimism's weekly candle formation could mark the beginning of a swing setup, aligning with a potential higher high structure on the daily timeframe.Since Optimism (OP) is currently testing the nearest moving average (MA20), a longer timeframe is anticipated for the price to return to the $4.00 level.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeOptimism is currently trading below all moving averages, suggesting a market in decline. Yet, its recent approach towards the nearest moving average (MA20) might hint at the beginnings of a market reversal. This is especially noteworthy given the respect shown for the historical consolidation around the $2.00 price level.Inflection Points to watch out forSupports:The immediate support for the price is at $2.11, with the subsequent backing at 1.80.Resistance:Surpassing the $3.03 mark could drive the price up to $3.412.Bullish Targets:A realistic target for now is around $3.412. However, achieving a target price level of $4.049 may require a longer holding period expectation for mid-term and long-term holders, given the challenge of breaking above all the moving averages.Bearish Targets:If the price falls below the $1.80 mark, it could potentially push down to around $1.21."}]}

Originally founded by Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot was designed to address the decentralised governance and interoperability challenges present in modern blockchains.Relay Chains and ParachainsRelay chains serve as the backbone of the Polkadot network, securing communication and coordination among parachains \u2013 independent blockchains that run concurrently to boost network scalability and efficiency. The Substrate framework, specifically developed for Polkadot, plays a crucial role in facilitating interoperability across various blockchains.Implications for Future ProjectsThe ability to facilitate interoperability among various blockchains is a significant advantage for new projects. This feature sets Polkadot apart from competitors in the Layer 0 space, enabling the exchange of assets and information across the network without requiring centralized intermediaries. However, it also poses challenges in ensuring scalability and security in a rapidly growing network. Polkadot is addressing these concerns through collaborations, continuous improvement, and relying on its unique governance model for fair and inclusive decision-making.Competitive Analysis: Cosmos vs. PolkadotCosmos, presented alongside Polkadot, offers another intriguing solution for Layer 0 platforms. Its protocol, Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), enables interoperability between independent chains as well, much like Polkadot. The main differences lie in their infrastructure capabilities and strategic advantages.Also, Cosmos leverages the Cosmos SDK, which allows for the creation of custom blockchains within the Cosmos Network. It utilizes a delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS) consensus mechanism and focuses on a decentralized exchange for inter-chain asset swaps. Polkadot, on the other hand, uses its unique hybrid Consensus Mechanism, Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS), and dedicated governance token, DOT, that enables stakeholders to vote on proposed upgrades, ecosystem development, and governance decisions.Both projects offer exciting possibilities, but the choice between them depends on the priorities of the developers, investors, and users. Those who value a more inclusive and decentralized governance model with dedicated resources for continuous improvement may lean towards Polkadot, while Cosmos may appeal to those looking for a more streamlined and customizable solution for building their blockchains.In conclusion, the rise of Cosmos and Polkadot as premier Layer 0 platforms highlights the increasing relevance of interoperability, scalability, and decentralized governance in blockchain's evolution. Both are pivotal in shaping blockchain's future, pushing the limits of decentralization with their innovative approaches. Their contributions enhance connectivity and efficiency within the blockchain ecosystem, ensuring their continued prominence in the sector. As the digital landscape evolves, their focus on interoperability positions them as key influencers in the blockchain community."}]}

Initially a governance asset, DYDX quickly evolved into the network's security, staking and governance centrepiece. Through a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, DYDX holders now reinforce the integrity of the network by staking tokens with validators.In a move towards greater security and decentralisation, the dYdX community settled 20 million DYDX with Stride on April 6, 2024. This strategic decision has not only strengthened the resilience of the network, but also fostered a more decentralised validator ecosystem.Staking DYDX tokens not only secures the network but also rewards participants with 100% of protocol fees in USDC, ensuring sustained engagement and growth. Governance shifts towards a more democratic model, with DYDX holders directly shaping the network\u2019s trajectory through voting and proposals. This evolution propels DYDX beyond its governance-only role, heralding a new era of community-driven DeFi governance.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsDYDX has rallied approximately 150% since its last low in October 2023. Subsequently, it has seen a 65% retracement in its price to retest the $1.61 area, which coincides with the 1.27 Fibonacci level from its last low.The price action of this asset usually tends to respect the reversal zones (between 0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) and the zone between 1.27-1.61 Fibonacci levels for retracements and trend continuations.It is currently bouncing off the 0.13 Fibonacci price zone from its 2024 high at $2.00. if this zone is rejected to the upside, this would be a bullish signal and a long trade could be attempted.Short-Term Price Targets-The lower confirmation entry would be at $2.05 if the price retests and regains the $2.00 level, but this entry would be at a lower confirmation level and therefore less likely to succeed.-A more confirmed entry would be once the 0.23 Fibonacci level and the last relative high at $2.5 are breached.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

The Bitcoin ETF was managed by China Asset Management, while three other firms\u2014Harvest Global, Bosera and Hashkey\u2014managed the Ethereum ETF. This development followed Hong Kong Exchange's (HKEX) successful launch of crypto futures ETFs in late 2022.Hong Kong ETF DebutThe debut of these new ETFs generated moderate interest, with a combined first-day trading volume of HK12 million. This figure is a marked contrast to the U.S. Bitcoin ETFs' first-day volume of 4.6 million. Heading into the launch, these ETFs had secured $140 million during their initial offering period.US vs. Hong Kong ETFsThe low trading volumes of these new spot BTC and ETH ETFs indicate that their performance may not closely mirror their U.S. counterparts. The clear disparity between the success of the U.S. Bitcoin ETFs and the lackluster debut of their Hong Kong counterparts positions the U.S. market as a significant benchmark for future growth.

Initially based in China, the company moved its headquarters to the CAYMAN ISLANDS before settling in Malta. Binance has since become one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, reportedly handling over $30 billion in daily trading volume as of February 2023. CZ, a Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur, started his professional career in the tech sector before venturing into cryptocurrencies. In 2014, he began working on Blockchain.info, an open-source block explorer, wallet and API provider. Before establishing Binance, CZ served as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of OKCoin.Binance Founder Under ScrutinyThe recent news regarding U.S. prosecutors seeking a three-year prison sentence for CZ in relation to money laundering activities on Binance is significant because of the platform's historical prominence and growth. The allegations against CZ, who stepped down as CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement deal, revolve around the platform's inability to prevent and actively conceal thousands of illicit transactions. Such activities include those supporting child sex abuse, illegal drug trade, terrorism and violations of U.S. sanctions. This puts the spotlight on the cryptocurrency exchange industry's regulatory challenges and the extent to which companies must adhere to international financial and legal guidelines, even as they serve a global client base.Impact of CZ's CaseThe outcome of this case will have a profound impact on Binance's future operations. Should CZ receive a prison sentence and additional fines or penalties, the damage to Binance's reputation could lead investors to lose confidence and withdraw their funds, resulting in significant declines in trading volume and market capitalization. Additionally, the case serves as a stark reminder for cryptocurrency exchanges to prioritize regulatory compliance and invest heavily in anti-money laundering programs. CZ's absence as the CEO could also lead to uncertainty regarding strategic initiatives and expected growth plans, creating instability in the market. Moreover, the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) actions against Binance may prompt other regulatory bodies and countries to investigate similar allegations against the company, potentially leading to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties.Binance Fallout: Bitcoin's Price RiskBinance's significant market influence, with its vast trading volume and substantial user base, could lead investors to reconsider their stance on cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a secure and trustworthy investment option. The course of this case, including the possible prison sentence and fines for CZ and potential regulatory fallout, has the potential to trigger a sell-off, leading to a decline in Bitcoin's price."}]}

The cryptocurrency has been fluctuating within a price range of $1.83 to $2.19. This period of consolidation has extended over three weeks; however, a notable increase in trading volume yesterday may indicate an impending change in momentum. The price is currently testing the Darvas Box resistance level set at $2.20, indicating the possibility of a breakout.What's Behind the Price Drag?-Market Technical Structure:After experiencing a substantial decrease in its price, LDO seems to be entering a consolidation phase, potentially setting the stage for its next upward swing.-Regulatory Impact in China:Due to the nation's prohibition on cryptocurrency transactions, Chinese investors are precluded from engaging in the market.-General Market Stance:Bitcoin is often regarded as the pioneer and leader in the cryptocurrency market, earning it the nickname \"the mother of all charts.\" Consequently, the price movements and trends observed in Bitcoin's chart frequently influence the behavior of other cryptocurrencies, leading many to follow its structure.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeLIDO DAO is presently positioned above the 100-day moving average, having revisited it three times over the past few weeks. Importantly, this moving average has been consistently respected since the drop preceding the Bitcoin halving.Despite the current price being below both the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, the overall structure of the moving averages remains intact, with the 20-day moving average above the 50-day moving average, and the 50-day moving average above the 100-day moving average. This suggests a strong foundation for the price. As long as the strongest moving average, the 100-day moving average continues to support the price, many retailers and investors may still be interested in participating in this setup.The trading volume observed yesterday significantly exceeded the average volume since the start of the consolidation period. This increased trading volume might herald the start of a new trend, especially as the price approaches the immediate resistance level established at $2.20.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeDespite the overall subdued sentiment in the general market, LDO's price has surged by 50% since the drop, rebounding from 1.43 to 2.19 (yesterday's closing price). Additionally, yesterday's trading volume marked the highest since the drop. These developments suggest a potential breakout from the accumulation phase and may herald the beginning of the acceleration stage for LDO.Inflection Points to watch out for-Supports:$1.83 is the immediate support level, with $1.43 following closely behind.-Resistance:LDO must surpass the $2.20 mark to confirm its upcoming upward trajectory, with the potential to extend as high as $2.55.Bullish Targets:A break above $2.55 could potentially lead the price to $3.01.Bearish Targets:Any catastrophic event capable of driving BTC's price below $60,000 has the capability of impacting the entire market including the best ALT coins.

After that, it re-tested the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) and broke out to the upside, almost forming a double top.Following this, its price underwent a 65% retracement and is now situated within the price zone of its historical low.Since the $30 price zone was rejected to the downside, the GMX price action is in a key area to decide whether to continue its downward path or to bounce off the reversal zone from its last relative high and head back upwards.The price zone between $24 and $22 must be respected on the upside, otherwise, it is likely to head towards $19.75 - $18.5.Short-Term Price TargetsAt this juncture, abearish scenarioappears more probable, hence the entry point would be once the reversion zone is reached.(0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) is broken to the downside at $23.5, and its probability of success would increase considerably once the low of $22.15 is breached.In the event of abullish trade, which appears less probable at this stage, the reversal zone between $24.1 and $25.6 should be rejected to the upside, which could take the price back to the $27 - $30 - $33 area in the short term.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

According to the VISA dashboard, Solana accounted for 42.3% of the stablecoin market share in March 2024. Solana's fast transaction processing speed and low fees have made it an attractive choice for stablecoin trading.This trend towards stablecoin dominance on the network is not new; Solana has consistently held a significant share of the stablecoin market.Tracking Solana's Transaction TrendThis article delves into a significant trend observed in Solana's transaction data, particularly concerning stablecoin activity. The notable surge in stablecoin transactions on the Solana network stems from various factors, including its inherent advantages and the growing popularity of memecoins and NFTs. However, amidst this surge, there are emerging concerns regarding the authenticity of some transactions, with indications suggesting a notable portion may originate from bots. Understanding this context offers valuable insights into the network's usage patterns and the potential challenges it faces.DeFi Challenges AheadSolana's strong stance in stablecoin transactions, while notable, does not necessarily translate to overall network health. The article points to a decrease in TVL, indicating a potential loss of user interest in Solana's DeFi offerings. Furthermore, the decline in NFT sector interest as evidenced by the drop in the Solana Floor NFT Blue Chip Index, and the fall in SOL staking, which could lead to fewer validators, might make the network more vulnerable to attacks.With that said, Solana's low fees and high-performance capabilities make it a lucrative platform for other sectors, such as stablecoins, memecoins, and potential future innovations.Balancing Act: Benefits and RisksSolana's position as a leader in stablecoin transactions comes with both opportunities and challenges. While its speed and low fees contribute to its attractiveness, there are concerns about the authenticity and potential impact of high transaction volumes on the network. The declining TVL and falling NFT sector interest may indicate a shift in user focus, while the decrease in SOL staking could impact the network's security.

Influenced by a 5% fall in Bitcoin, the wider market downturn has similarly affected RPL, leading to a 9.7% decrease.\u00a0 However, today's price action may signal a swing high setup, with the immediate support showing a reaction and forming a classic double bottom pattern.What's Behind the Price Drop?-General Market Stance:Indeed, Bitcoin holds a special status in the cryptocurrency market, often referred to as \"the mother of all charts\" due to its pioneering role and dominant position. As a result, the price movements and trends seen in Bitcoin's chart have a significant impact on other cryptocurrencies. Many traders and investors closely monitor the price action of the leading crypto-asset as a barometer for the overall market sentiment, with movements in Bitcoin often influencing the behavior of other digital assets, leading them to follow its structure.-Market Technical Structure:Despite undergoing a significant price decrease, RPL appears to remain in a consolidation stage, with its price still confined within the candle range dating back to April 13th.-Relative Strength Index (RSI):When the RSI is below the middle line or 50, it suggests that the price is experiencing a significant ranging phase before potentially embarking on another rally. This indicates a period of consolidation and suggests that the market may be preparing for a potential upward movement in the future.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeRocket Pool's reaction to the $18 price level could indeed signal the end of the sell-off, especially if it attempts to bounce back from this level. This potential rebound might also herald the emergence of a classic double-bottom pattern, a bullish reversal indicator that suggests a likely shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. Traders and investors may monitor this development closely for potential buying opportunities.Considering the current status of the moving averages plotted on the RPL chart, it's noteworthy that the nearest moving average (MA20) has recently been approached for a potential breach. Should the price manage to rise above this moving average, it could serve as a significant indicator of a potential shift in trend. Traders often view such movements above key moving averages as signals of bullish momentum and a potential reversal of the previous downtrend. Therefore, closely monitoring the price action around the MA20 level could provide valuable insights into the future direction of RPL.Today's price action is particularly noteworthy as it demonstrates a strong push, with the price revisiting a key level or the bottom of the downtrend observed during the last bear market in October 2023. This level holds significant historical importance and may act as a crucial support or resistance point. Traders and investors will likely closely monitor how the price reacts around this level, as it could provide valuable insights into the current market sentiment and potential future price movements.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeAmidst significant declines in the general market over the past 48 hours, a bullish divergence in the RSI has been identified. This divergence occurs as the price potentially confirms a double bottom pattern, reacting to the $18.00 price level. Despite persistent challenges in breaking out above the nearest moving average (MA20), the current price is resting on a historical low or key level, suggesting strong support. Any news related to a price spike in BTC could potentially propel the price back to the $20 levels. Traders may closely monitor these developments for potential trading opportunities.Inflection Points to watch out for-Supports:$18.00 is the immediate support level, with $10 following closely behind.-Resistance:RPLD must surpass the $21.41 mark to confirm its upcoming upward trajectory, with the potential to extend as high as $24.62.Bullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period, is set at $25.76.Bearish Targets:A break below $18.00 could potentially lead the price down to $10.00."}]}

Despite an attempted break from the market structure observed last week, the price lacked follow-through, potentially signalling a revisit of the recent low to confirm a double-bottom pattern. Traders may monitor this pattern closely for potential trend reversal signals.What's Behind the Price Drop?-BTC\u2019s correction:During periods of daily declines in Bitcoin ranging from 1% to 5%, the ALT coin markets often face considerable downturns, with prices typically falling by approximately 20%.

This illustrates the considerable impact that Bitcoin's price movements can have on the broader cryptocurrency market, including ALT coins like FXS.-The MA100 breakdown:For short-term and mid-term holders, the 100-day moving average is often considered the strongest, and a price crossing below it frequently triggers a sell-off.

This highlights the significance of the MA100 as a key level for traders and investors, and how price movements relative to this average can influence market sentiment and trading decisions.-General Market Interest:As the general market capitalization remains subdued, including a lack of enthusiasm in BTC, FXS has also witnessed a decline in retail interest. Moreover, the volume over the past 3 weeks has been decreasing. While this may initially seem concerning, it could actually be interpreted as a positive sign. A decline in volume suggests a drying up of sellers, indicating that bearish momentum may be weakening. This could potentially pave the way for bulls to take control of the market soon. Traders and investors may interpret this as a possible precursor to a bullish reversal in FXS.-Relative Strength Index (RSI):When the RSI dips below 30, it typically indicates an oversold condition and may suggest a severe downtrend. However, if RSI levels are attempting to challenge and stay above the 30 mark, it could signal a potential end to the consolidation phase. This behaviour may indicate that selling pressure is weakening, potentially paving the way for a reversal or a period of consolidation before a possible uptrend. Traders often monitor RSI levels alongside other technical indicators to assess market conditions and identify potential turning points in price movements.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeOver the past 3 weeks, FXS has remained relatively stagnant despite operating in a ranging market, with volume constantly staying below average. While potential catalysts may drive general market sentiment, they might not necessarily attract retailers to participate in FXS, given its current structure and market conditions. However, for long-term investors, the recent price structure presents an opportune moment, with FXS positioned at a favourable support zone and available at a discounted price.This may present an attractive entry point for investors with a long-term perspective, offering an opportunity to capitalise on potential future growth as market conditions begin to improve.With all the moving averages pointing downwards, the price of FXS is approaching a critical juncture where it may challenge the nearest moving average (MA20) soon. If the price successfully breaks and stays above the MA20, it could signal a significant shift in momentum. This presents an opportunity for traders to consider taking an initial position or risk exposure to participate in the potential next move. However, traders should exercise caution and wait for confirmation of the breakout before making any trading decisions.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeDespite facing persistent challenges in breaking out above the nearest moving average (MA20), FXS's current price is finding support at a historically low or key level of around $4.20. This level suggests strong support amidst market turbulence. Moreover, amidst significant declines in the general market over the past 48 hours, a bullish divergence in the RSI has emerged. This divergence, coupled with the potential confirmation of a double bottom pattern, as the price reacts to the $3.80 price level, may indicate a potential reversal in FXS's price action.Inflection Points to watch out for-Supports:$3.80 serves as the immediate support level for FXS, with $1.90 closely following as the next potential support level. These levels are crucial for traders to monitor, as a breach below $3.80 could potentially lead to a further decline towards the $1.90 support level. Conversely, if $3.80 holds, it may signal a strong support zone for FXS and could potentially lead to a rebound in price. Traders should keep a close eye on price action around these support levels for potential trading opportunities.-Resistance:For FXS to confirm its upcoming upward trajectory, it must surpass the $5.58 mark, which serves as a key resistance level. Breaking above this level could signal a shift in momentum and pave the way for further upside potential. Additionally, if FXS manages to surpass $5.58, it has the potential to extend its rally towards the $8.14 mark. Traders and investors should closely monitor price action around these levels for confirmation of bullish momentum and potential trading opportunities.Bullish Targets:The nearest target is set at $5.6.Bearish Targets:A break below $3.80 could potentially lead the price down to $1.90."}]}

This infrastructure is essential for Cosmos as it fosters interoperability, a critical component for competition in the Layer 0 space. Substrate, developed by the Web3 Foundation, allows for the creation of custom-built blockchains that can communicate with each other, enhancing the functionality and value of each individual network (Polkadot, Kusama, etc.). This interconnectedness can be advantageous for Cosmos as it aims to be a competitive interoperability platform.Polkadot: Seamless IntegrationPolkadot's development and adoption of interoperability via the Substrate framework and its various staking options correlate to the essential aspects of Layer 0 technologies - security, scalability, and decentralization. Staking helps secure the network and offers users a passive income, while interoperability increases utility and connectivity among various blockchains.Shaping Future Layer 0Developments like Polkadot's interoperability and staking could set a precedent for future Layer 0 projects that choose to build on similar frameworks, leveraging interoperability as a strategic advantage. However, it is vital to acknowledge the risks associated with these staking mechanisms, such as protocol-level risks and potential censorship from centralized exchanges.Cosmos: Interoperability UnleashedCosmos, another Layer 0 protocol, distinguishes itself from competitors like Polkadot and Quant by focusing on interoperability via the Cosmos-SDK. While Cosmos Share (ATOM) staking, like its competitors, serves to secure the network and provide rewards, its interoperable nature sets it apart, allowing it to connect with various independent, parallel blockchains. This interoperability, facilitated by the IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol, can potentially give Cosmos a strong strategic advantage, making it an appealing option for both developers and users seeking a more comprehensive, cohesive blockchain ecosystem.In terms of infrastructure capabilities, Cosmos's focus on interchain communication through the IBC protocol allows for seamless interaction between multiple independent blockchains, increasing its potential for usability and practical applications across various industries. In contrast, Polkadot and Quant carry their unique flavours of interconnectedness via their respective Parachains and Overledger protocols. While both have their merits, Cosmos's singular focus on interoperability may give it an edge in terms of ease of use and integration possibilities within its ecosystem.Additionally, Cosmos's independently governed Hub is another factor that could provide strategic advantages in the long run. This approach minimizes the centralization risks associated with a single control centre while maintaining the flexibility and adaptability of a decentralized ecosystem. Users and developers alike can trust that innovation within the network will be driven by the community rather than a singular entity.In conclusion, the developments surrounding staking and interoperability in Layer 0 protocols like Cosmos, Polkadot, and Quant, are significant in shaping the future of these projects and the broader blockchain industry as a whole. By adopting innovative staking mechanisms and a focus on interoperability, these Layer 0 platforms pave the way for a more interconnected, decentralized, and complex blockchain ecosystem where individual projects can thrive and contribute to larger expansion and innovation.However, it's essential to remember that risks do exist within these systems, such as potential centralization risks in the case of Cosmos and Quant's Hubs or the higher protocol-level risks in third-party decentralized protocols. As always, users and investors must evaluate these risks, ensure they're comfortable with the trade-offs and exercise due diligence when staking their assets."}]}

This quick recovery could be targeting stop losses set by retail investors. Presently, BTC is positioned above the breakout of the trendline, indicating potential bullish momentum. Despite still being under the bearish territory of the Darvas Box, all parameters seem to be aligned for a potential break above the $65,000 price level.What's Behind the Price Spike?-Bitcoin Longs erase $100M in 1 day:The data from Crypto Rank indicating over $464 million in liquidations in the cryptocurrency market on 1st May, with Bitcoin accounting for over $136 million, suggests significant market activity and potential volatility. In such situations, liquidations could indeed serve as an early sign of institutions positioning themselves for the next rally. This scenario aligns with a classic play of market makers, who often take advantage of price fluctuations and investor sentiment to strategically enter or exit positions. Monitoring liquidation data is very useful for gauging market dynamics and possible trends.-Moving Average 20 Trail:The first time Bitcoin touches the 20-week moving average signifies a strong rebound, especially when all the moving averages (MAs) are still aligned and well-structured. This occurrence often indicates a significant level of support and potential buying interest from traders and investors. The alignment of MAs suggests that the overall trend remains intact, and the touch of the 20-week MA may serve as a key entry point for those looking to capitalize on the rebound.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeThe fakeout observed last week may be seen as a classic manoeuvre by market makers, leading to the liquidation of approximately $164 million worth of BTC as it fell by 11% over two consecutive days.The weekly volume holds significant relevance, especially if it surpasses the previous week's trading volume, as it confirms a strong recovery. This observation is particularly pertinent as BTC continues to hold strongly above the $60,000 mark. Higher trading volume accompanying price movement signifies increased participation and conviction among market participants, reinforcing the strength of the current trend. Therefore, a higher weekly volume compared to the previous week's volume serves as a positive indication of the market's resilience and potential for further upward momentum in BTC's price.Indeed, the RSI reaching 70 around $65,895, along with the MA20 breakout on the weekly timeframe, indicates a significant level of resistance. This confluence suggests potential overbought conditions and raises the possibility of a reversal in BTC's price momentum. It is important to monitor this level closely for possible price reactions and consider it a key area for profit-taking or re-evaluating positions.However, it's important to note that a break above the RSI 70 level typically confirms a parabolic move. Such a move could signify a surge in buying pressure and a continuation of the upward trend. Therefore, traders and investors should also be prepared for further price appreciation if BTC manages to break through this resistance level convincingly.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeBTC has indeed broken out of its short-term trend, surpassing the $64,000 level, which aligns with the confluence of the 20-day moving average on the daily timeframe. This breakout suggests bullish momentum, with both the MA20 and MA50 exerting pressure on the price, potentially leading to an explosive move to the upside.The recent price action further confirms this bullish sentiment, as BTC broke above the MA20, followed by yesterday's candle validating the breakout with a retest. These validation candles are indicative of market strength and support the likelihood of further upward movement in BTC's price. These signals may be potential opportunities to enter long positions or add to existing positions in anticipation of continued upside momentum in BTC.Key Inflection Points to Monitor-Supports:Immediate support at $59,695, with further support at $50,792.-Resistance:BTC needs to break above $65,952 to confirm its next leg up and stay above the box's bullish side.Bullish Targets:A break above $73,800 could potentially lead the price to $81,800.Bearish Targets:Any catastrophic event capable of driving BTC's price below $60,000 has the potential to induce chaos across the entire market, potentially leading BTC to revisit $50,000."}]}

Despite its sluggish movement, ETH's recent price behaviour has been adhering closely to the strongest moving average, the MA100. This suggests that despite the consolidation, there is underlying support at this level, which may potentially serve as a launching pad for a future uptrend once market sentiment improves.Causes of Slow Price-Performance:Ethereum has experienced a pullback of over 30% since its drop over the past few weeks, compared to Bitcoin's 20% pullback. This disparity in pullback percentages highlights the relatively greater volatility and downside pressure that Ethereum has faced in comparison to Bitcoin during this period.-Market Cycle:ETH is currently experiencing a consolidation phase, characterized by a one-candle pattern. To confirm a potential shift in trend, ETH must break out of this consolidation pattern. A move beyond the current consolidation range could signify renewed momentum and herald the start of a new trend direction.-Capital Rotation:As Ethereum is anticipated to continue ranging for a few more weeks, some retailers may consider investing in other assets that demonstrate more immediate potential for growth.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeEthereum continues to rest on its immediate support level, indicating ongoing stability but also suggesting a potential period of consolidation before it transitions to the bullish side of the box on the weekly timeframe. This suggests that Ethereum may need some time to gather momentum and establish a clear upward trend.To break above the trendline, Ethereum (ETH) would need to make a 5-6% move. This move is crucial as it aligns with breaking the fourth week of consolidation. Such a move would signify a potential shift in market sentiment and could lead to renewed bullish momentum for ETH. It is important to follow the price action closely to assess whether ETH manages to break above the trend line and the consolidation period, as this could present trading opportunities and signal the start of a new trend.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeA larger flag pattern has been identified in the daily timeframe for Ethereum, with the price currently consolidating inside it. Ethereum has attempted to break out of this pattern multiple times, and it is poised to challenge the upper boundary of the triangle once again. If Ethereum successfully breaks above the triangle pattern, it could signify a shift in trend and mark the beginning of its next rally.Key Inflection Points to monitor-Supports:$2.824 as immediate support, followed by $2,200-Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $3,300.Bullish Targets:At the moment, the nearest target for ETH is projected at $3,700.Bearish Targets:A break below $2,814 could potentially lead the price down to $2,200."}]}

Historically, SOLWealth has focused on offering investment solutions for various asset classes, including alternative investments and private equity. Their entry into the crypto space indicates a broader adoption of digital assets by traditional financial institutions.Solana ETF Amid SEC ChallengesThe announcement of a Solana ETF by SOLWealth coincides with ongoing regulatory challenges faced by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in approving Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoin ETFs. With institutional investors increasingly expressing interest in Solana, SOLWealth's move to offer a SOL ETF capitalizes on investor demand for indirect exposure to digital assets through regulated investment vehicles.Implications of Solana's ETF LaunchThe launch of a Solana ETF brings several potential implications for SOL and the wider crypto space. For SOL, an ETF can increase its exposure to a larger and more diverse investor base, potentially driving demand and further price appreciation. On a broader level, the establishment of a Solana ETF strengthens the case for other altcoins to follow suit, potentially democratizing access to various investment opportunities in the crypto space.However, it is essential to acknowledge the potential downsides. Regulatory approval and partnerships, as mentioned by SOLWealth CEO Francois Soto, are critical factors that can impact the success and timely launch of the ETF. Additionally, Solana's network outages and regulatory concerns add an element of risk that investors should consider before investing in the ETF or directly in Solana.Why SOL Stands OutAlthough Bitcoin and Ethereum have their ETFs, there are several reasons why Solana's move is noteworthy. Solana's advanced technology, such as its fast confirmations and low transaction fees, distinguishes it from its competitors. Furthermore, strategic partnerships and widespread adoption by institutions and projects position Solana to attract a large investor base. The partnerships include collaboration with Adidas and Animoca Brands, which can drive both use cases and adoption of the Solana network. These factors, along with the potential for a regulated investment vehicle like an ETF, make Solana an attractive alternative for investors seeking exposure to crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum."}]}

In response to the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, investors have been keen on regulated investment avenues to access Ethereum's potential, mirroring the demand for regulated Bitcoin ETFs. Notable investment firms such as VanEck and ARK Invest have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Ethereum spot ETFs. These ETFs would offer investors exposure to the underlying cryptocurrency, providing benefits like convenience, instant liquidity, and opportunities for short-selling. However, the development of these investment products hinges on the SEC's classification of Ethereum as either a commodity or a security, a distinction crucial for determining Ethereum's institutional acceptance and future growth prospects.ETH ETF Approval HurdlesMichael Saylor's prediction that the SEC may classify Ethereum as a security fuels growing concerns regarding the regulatory landscape for Ethereum and its prospective ETFs. As a vocal advocate for Bitcoin and its institutional acceptance, Saylor's stance adds gravity to the ongoing debate within the crypto community. The regulatory distinction between Bitcoin and Ethereum remains unclear, and the classification of Ethereum as a security may complicate the approval process for ETFs and impose additional reporting and compliance requirements on the Ethereum network and its participants.SEC Classification ConcernsIf Ethereum is classified as a security, it would significantly alter the regulatory landscape for ETH and ETF applicants. The Howey Test, the SEC's primary tool for determining the definition of a security, might not align with Ethereum's decentralized nature, making it challenging for ETFs to directly track the underlying asset. The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 could potentially apply to Ethereum, bringing increased reporting and compliance requirements. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum may deter institutional investors, as they prefer the ease and regulatory safety offered by ETFs, resulting in a negative impact on Ethereum's adoption and potential market performance.Growth Amid RegulationsDespite the regulatory challenges, Ethereum's rapid progress in DeFi and NFTs sectors underscores its continuous growth potential and significance within the crypto landscape. Institutions eyeing Ethereum exposure may consider alternative investment vehicles, such as investment trusts or actively managed funds, which could circumvent the regulatory hurdles surrounding Ethereum ETFs. Furthermore, the increasing popularity and adoption of decentralized finance, which operates on Ethereum's blockchain, suggest that the Ethereum ecosystem's innovation and expansion may not be impeded by the regulatory concerns alone. Thus, Ethereum's future growth and acceptance may not hinge entirely on the regulatory decisions surrounding its ETFs but on its continued development and integration into established financial systems."}]}

Its price has been trading within a range of $0.5822 to $0.9503 on the larger timeframe for approximately 24 days. The recent attempt to break out of this consolidation range yesterday could attract market participants' attention. Additionally, MATIC is now trading above the nearest moving average (MA20) for the first time since March, which may signal a potential shift in trend.Causes of Sluggish Price Action-Performance:Polygon has suffered a sharp decline of over 50% since the sell-off last March. Anticipating a rebound to the recent highs will require a realistic consolidation period.-Market Cycle:As MATIC has potentially established its base after a series of lower highs and lower lows, an ideal breakout is likely to occur soon.-Moving Averages:With all the moving averages still in inverted positions (MA20 below MA50 and MA50 below MA100), the price's attempt to recover and close the gap with the nearest moving average of 20 may signify the beginning of a reversal.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframe-After a five-week decline, MATIC attempted to break above the highest price of the range ($0.7726). However, the breakout was unsuccessful and it may still undergo another swing low.-MATIC has demonstrated minor strength as the price has remained above the moving average for five days since the March 2024 sell-off.-In addition, its Relative Strength Index is still below 50, suggesting a potential for a longer consolidation period. A break above 50 in the RSI could indicate a new structure, eliminating the possibility of lower lows.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeAs an established base is observed during consolidation between $0.5822 and $0.7726, the RSI50 is projected at $0.7099 on the lower timeframe (daily), potentially contributing to yesterday's failed breakout. However, yesterday's volume, while significant, is not as relevant as May 01, 2024, which recorded one of the highest volumes since the recent consolidation. Nevertheless, even though further consolidation may occur, it is now expected to take place near the resistance level.Key Inflection Points to monitor-Supports:$0.6512 as immediate support, followed by $0.50-Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $0.7726.Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $0.7726, the $1.00 price could be the next target.Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $0.5822."}]}

Uniswap Labs, however, argues it only developed the front-end portal, with the protocol being separate. Despite regulatory challenges, Uniswap remains resilient in the DeFi sector.Uniswap's trading volume dipped nearly 10% following a Wells notice from the SEC, totaling $2.7 billion across Ethereum and Arbitrum networks, with the steepest decline seen on Uniswap V3. The UNI token also plummeted to $9.09 amid the news, prompting three major investors to sell 2.03 million UNI, worth $20 million, on centralised exchanges.This action reflects a broader trend of regulatory scrutiny on decentralised platforms, highlighting concerns of overreach.

Over the past 9 weeks, no bullish candle has been observed on the weekly timeframe. However, there have been pauses during this period, and the swing low may be nearing its end as the price is currently attempting to break above the nearest moving average (MA20).Sluggish price reasons:-General Market Sentiment:Bitcoin has yet to regain its momentum following a four-week decline. When BTC experiences daily declines ranging from 1% to 5%, it often triggers significant downturns in the ALT coin markets, resulting in prices falling by approximately 20%.-The MA100 breakdown:For short-term and mid-term holders, the 100-day moving average is typically regarded as the strongest, and a price crossing below it often triggers a sell-off. When Arbitrum's price dropped below the $1.70 level, coinciding with a breakdown below the MA100, it experienced a sharp decline. Coincidentally, a 60% upward move is required for the price to rise above the 100-day moving average.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeArbitrum is consolidating on the wick of the biggest bearish weekly candle, ranging from $0.8956 to $1.1854. This level could hold significant value for long-term investors, as the price has not yet attempted to break above $1.1854.Despite the 9-week decline, including 4 weeks of sluggish movement, the price is approaching the strongest support level between $0.9316 and $0.7951.The Relative Strength Index is still below 50 on the weekly timeframe, with the middle line (RSI50) pegged at $1.4255. This suggests that a 40% upward move is needed for Arbitrum to regain its momentum.Currently, ARB is consolidating within a range of $0.8956 to $1.1918 on the daily timeframe. However, attempts to break out of this range were not sustained due to the overall market sentiment.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeArbitrum's daily RSI level is consolidating between 30 and 40, indicating a prolonged consolidation period. The price is currently below the three key moving averages (MA20, MA50, and MA100), suggesting it may undergo an extended consolidation phase. However, despite this, the price has already tested the nearest moving average (MA20) twice without establishing a new lower-low structure. This could signify the end of the downtrend and the beginning of a new structure once it successfully breaks above the 20-day moving average.Inflection Points to watch out for:-Supports:The immediate support for the price is at $0.8956, with subsequent support at $0.7860.-Resistance:Surpassing the $1.1834 mark could drive the price up to $1.4255.Bullish Targets:A realistic target with a shorter holding period is pegged at $1.4255.Bearish Targets:If the price falls below the $0.8956 mark, it could potentially push down to around $0.74."}]}

SushiSwap's journey to fortify its ecosystem is marred by trust issues and internal strife, underscoring the delicate balance between innovation and governance in the decentralised exchange landscape.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsSUSHI had a maximum rise of approximately 308% from its October low to its March 2024 high.After that, there was a price drop of 64% towards the 0.13 Fibonacci level from its March 2022 high.Its price action is currently inside the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from its October 2023 low, a zone it has held for more than 3 weeks.A break below $0.88, i.e. the 0.78 Fibonacci level from its October low, could lead to a fall towards the $0.67 - $0.56 area again.For there to be a price recovery, it is essential to break back below the $1.15 price zone and hold it consistently.Short-Term Price TargetsA breakout to the upside of the $1.15 price zone would not only be a rejection of the above-mentioned reversal zone, but also a break of the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the last high of March 2024.So once the price breaks above and sustains this zone, at $1.2 a long entry could be made with a higher probability of success.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

Currently, it is showing respect for the moving average of 20, having successfully broken above it.Reasons for Price Recovery-BTC\u2019s correction aligned with BTCDom\u2019s breakout:As Bitcoin began to recover, BTCDom made a notable advance by staying above the crucial threshold, indicating a likely successful breakout and potentially establishing a new peak. As a result, when Bitcoin gains momentum, the broader market often responds with movements that are three to four times more pronounced, due to its liquidity.-Historical Support:The bounce level of Optimism is closely tied to its historical value, which is near $2.00. This level has proven significant in the past and has recently seen a notable move when the price successfully broke out above the MA20. This breakout occurred after seven attempts since the sell-off that took place last March.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeOptimism has already retested the previous breakout zone, situated between $1.91 and $2.169, coinciding with the trailing moving average of 50, as observed in the chart above. Notably, the weekly moving average of 100 is approaching the $2.00 price mark, aligning with the retested breakout zone from the previous week. This confluence could serve as the strongest support for investors before considering exiting their positions.A consolidation confined to a single candle's range is possible, given that the last three weeks' candles remain within the $1.8 to $3.4 range. There's potential for a moving average price squeeze in the coming weeks, considering that the price is currently situated between the moving average of 20 and the moving average of 50.An inverted head and shoulders pattern is emerging and could potentially take shape if the immediate support at $1.80 holds and the price then climbs back to $4.53.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeOptimism is making a concerted effort to break out of the downtrend, with the price surpassing the moving average of 20 for the first time since the sell-off. Examining the historical data on the left side of the chart, there's evidence of a short-term consolidation, which can be confidently identified as mid-term support, aligning with the breakout of the structure around $2.45. Currently, OP is adhering to the channel line, oscillating between the $2.5 and $3.4 range.Key Inflection Points-Supports:The immediate support for the price is at $2.11, with the subsequent backing at 1.80.-Resistance:Surpassing the $ 3.3 mark could drive the price up to $4.Bullish Targets:The nearest target is set at $3.3, aligning with the resistance of the channel line and coinciding with the 100-day moving average.Bearish Targets:If the price falls below $1.80, it could potentially drop to approximately $1.21."}]}

This restructuring move, aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and accelerating protocol development, reflects a proactive approach to evolving SushiSwap's organisational structure. The proposal's approval indicatesgrowing community involvementin decision-making processes, exemplified by Sushigov.eth's first-time vote with significant voting power. Moreover, thepotential for future airdrops directed solely to the Sushi Labs entity incentivizes investors to hold onto SUSHI tokens, driving up demand and prices. This combination of factors, including enhanced protocol development prospects and increased community participation, has contributed to thepositive market responseto the governance proposal.On the other hand,PancakeSwap's market cap increase and the price increasecan be attributed to several significant developments within the protocol. Firstly, thesuccessful passing of a proposal introducing veCAKE (vote-escrowed CAKE) and gauge votingto the protocol indicates a strategic shift towardsempowering CAKE holders with increased governance influence and boosting liquidityacross PancakeSwap pools. This move not only enhances the protocol's governance structure but alsoincreases rewards for CAKE stakers, potentially attracting more users and investorsto participate in the ecosystem. Furthermore, the allocation of40% of emissions to provide liquidity for core LP pairs, along with the option for veCAKE holders to earn third-party incentives for specific liquidity pools, ensures the health and efficiencyof the protocol while incentivizing participation. Additionally, theapproval of a proposal to redirect CAKE emissions to strategic pools as bribes, aiming to improve liquidity and efficiency without increasing overall emissions, furtherstrengthens PancakeSwap's positionand attractiveness to users. Lastly,anticipation surrounding the project's new product launch, as hinted in a recent tweet,adds to the positive sentimentand investor confidence.Finally, theSEC's action against Uniswap, signalled by the Wells notice, has broughtattention to the regulatory uncertaintiessurrounding DeFi platforms.Allegations suggest that certain tokens traded on Uniswap may constitute securities, raising concernsabout compliance with federal securities laws.However, Uniswap's response, emphasising the protocol's decentralised nature and separating it from Uniswap Labs' control, presents a defence strategythat highlights the platform's autonomous operation. This distinction between the protocol and the development team may mitigate regulatory concerns and reassure investors about the platform's regulatory compliance and long-term viability. Furthermore, theargument that Uniswap's protocol can be interacted with independently of the front end strengthens the narrative of decentralisation, potentially boosting confidence in the platform's resilience against regulatory challenges."}]}

However, community members expressed apprehensions regarding financial stability and allegations of voting manipulation, highlighting the importance of maintaining the project's integrity while pursuing growth opportunities.In addition to the turbulence regarding the change in the governance model, during April the DeFi exchanges market suffered strong turbulence due to the Wells Notice issued by the SEC against Uniswap, hinting at regulatory changes.The debate revolves around whether DeFi platforms should be regulated as securities brokers, impacting other cryptocurrencies as SUSHI which, in the week of the announcement, ended the week with a -21% drop.Featured Cryptocurrency of the Week: SUSHIThis Week's Breakthroughs:Despite the fall in the overall altcoin market and the hit suffered by the SEC's Wells Notice against Uniswap, SUSHI is finishing its 4th week in a row in positive territory, with approximately 14% price gain for the entire period.Following the April moves regarding the governance change, the Sushiswap community approved the transfer of most of SUSHI's treasury funds to the new entity called \"Labs\", which will become responsible for the financial management of the exchange.Technical AnalysisRecent Price Movements:SUSHI's price action is respecting an ascending line, marked in orange on the chart, which if respected could lead the price to definitively break the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from its last low of October 2023, thus increasing the probability of a bullish rebound.In addition to this, SUSHI has broken higher during Thursday 9th May the 0.23 Fibonacci level from its last low, which could also be considered as a positive sign that could lead the price to further upside.Future Perspectives:Being close to breaking the above mentioned reversal zone at $1.15, it is essential that there is a daily candlestick close above this zone and that this level is sustained to the upside.Once above this level, a long can be attempted from $1.15 and ideally $1.2 for additional security.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesUniswap (UNI):The SEC's Wells notice to Uniswap alleges unregistered securities brokerage due to platform control. Despite regulatory pressure, Uniswap's trading volume fell 10%, totaling $2.7 billion, and UNI token plummeted to $9.09, prompting a millonaire sell-off. This highlights broader regulatory concerns in DeFi. Strengthening security through audits and regulatory engagement is crucial for mainstream adoption amidst growing scrutiny.This week the price of UNI remains in a sideways range, but still above its long term uptrend line, which is a good sign for the moment.PancakeSwap(CAKE):CAKE held support this week at the $2.66 price zone, which coincides with the 0.61 Fibonacci level from its October 2023 low.

This week, the sluggish and declining price movement may be attributed to resistance encountered at the middle line of the Darvas Box, which coincides with the moving average 50. Despite last week's breakout, the notion that a retest is needed before resuming bullish momentum could dominate this week's trading sentiment. This idea is supported by historical patterns, as Bitcoin often consolidates and experiences pullbacks in the aftermath of its halving events before initiating significant moves.Technical Analysis InsightsThree weeks have passed since the Halving, and Bitcoin's price remains within a wide range, fluctuating between $73,800 and $56,542. However, the stabilization of BTCDom, which is currently above the critical level of $2380, suggests that this could signal the potential bottom for BTC.Bitcoin is currently hovering around its strongest moving average, the MA100, on the daily timeframe. This indicates a possible extended consolidation period, especially as BTCDOM remains stable around the $2400 level without showing clear directional movement. As long as BTCDOM stays at this level, Bitcoin's price may experience sluggish movement.Finally, on the weekly timeframe, BTCDom is adhering closely to the fastest moving average, demonstrating a consistent behavior since 2023. This suggests that the broader market, including long-term investors, maintains its interest in Bitcoin, as evidenced by its sustained relationship with this key indicator.Potential Weekend Outcomes1. An inverse head and shoulders pattern appears to be forming, with the right shoulder set to confirm at the $61,198 support level. Interestingly, this price aligns closely with the strongest moving average and coincides with the retest zone of the trendline. Should this trade scenario play out, BTC could potentially breach the $65,000 mark, signaling a shift in momentum as it enters the bullish side of the box.2. On a broader scale, BTC is expected to consolidate within the range of $73,800 to $56,542. Despite the recent sell-off causing significant liquidations, it's considered a healthy pullback. The weekly structure of Bitcoin remains intact, with no lower low structure created yet. This suggests that the price decline is likely just a healthy correction.3. BTC dropping below $60,000 would likely necessitate significant external catalysts that induce fear and uncertainty in the market. Such catalysts could include regulatory crackdowns, security breaches, or broader macroeconomic instability. In the absence of such events, BTC's trajectory is anticipated to remain influenced by existing market dynamics, investor sentiment, and underlying fundamental factors shaping the cryptocurrency landscape.SnapshotBTCDom has consistently maintained its position above the previous breakout zone at $2,380 and has now stabilized, tracking closely along the moving average 20 on the weekly timeframe.Bitcoin is on the verge of testing the resistance level within the middle box as its price approaches the $65,000 mark.Bitcoin's momentum might not be fully evident yet, but it could shift soon, especially as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 48.48. A break above the 50 level in the RSI could drive the price higher.Weekend and Monday OutlookA 4% or higher move in BTC is indeed considered significant in terms of volatility. Yesterday\u2019s move closed at roughly 3% from the opening, which is also noteworthy. Despite the lack of volume, the structure could entice retail investors and traders to participate in anticipation of a potential break above the bullish consolidation area.Forecast FlashBTC could potentially experience another 6% move over the next two days if BTCDom remains above the $2,380 level."}]}

Initially, the price dipped below the 100-day moving average, only to swiftly rebound within two days. However, this rebound was short-lived, and the price is now back below the moving average. Despite this, the broader picture remains intact, with the drop since March amounting to only 23% from the all-time high. This decline is viewed as a healthy pullback in the larger timeframe.What's Behind the Slow Price Movement?No potential catalysts:Investors and retailers are eagerly awaiting news that could potentially move Bitcoin's price, similar to the effect of the BTC ETF Approval earlier this year. However, as of now, no catalysts have emerged across the board to trigger such a movement.Long Consolidation after a Parabolic Run:Bitcoin's recent 5-week rally was quite impressive, surging as high as 80% from $42,500 to its recent all-time high at $73,800. However, it's typical for the price not to continue rising indefinitely; instead, it often experiences pullbacks and consolidation phases before embarking on its next upward movement.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeThe trendline on the weekly timeframe has been a significant short-term resistance, with the price reacting to it over the past 5 weeks. However, this week's opening offers a glimmer of hope, as the price has broken out of that resistance line.Building on the previous point, the 20-day moving average may provide support to the price as it approaches the $60,000 mark. Currently situated at $57,713, it is also nearing the aforementioned trendline, adding to its potential significance as a support level.Despite the price remaining within the bearish territory of the Darvas Box, the overall market structure, including all moving averages, remains intact. The pullback, although significant, is still below 30%, and the price is currently positioned above the nearest moving average.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeThe recent fakeout observed over the last two weeks could be interpreted as a classic maneuver by market makers. This move led to the liquidation of approximately $164 million worth of BTC, with a decline of 11% over two consecutive days. However, this event failed to stimulate broader market participation in BTC's next upward move.Bitcoin is currently challenging both the 20-day and 100-day moving averages, with the price attempting to break above the $63,000 mark. This price level coincides with the RSI50, which is currently pegged at $62,929. If the price manages to surpass the RSI50 for the first time since the sell-off, it could signal the beginning of the bull's takeover.Although Bitcoin's price is still consolidating within a narrow range of $63,465 to $60,180, the current price action suggests a potential retest of the trendline.Key Inflection Points to MonitorSupports:Immediate support at $60,180, with further support at $56,542.Resistance:BTC needs to break above $65,416 to confirm its next leg up and stay above the box's bullish side.Bullish Targets:A break above $73,800 could potentially lead the price to $81,800.Bearish Targets:Any catastrophic event capable of driving BTC's price below $60,000 has the potential to induce chaos across the entire market, potentially leading BTC to revisit $50,000."}]}

Despite this consolidation, Ethereum has experienced a pullback of over 30% in recent weeks, exceeding Bitcoin's 20% pullback. This discrepancy underscores the relatively higher volatility and downward pressure that Ethereum has encountered compared to Bitcoin during this period.Causes of Slow PriceRumors about SOLANA to be the next ETHEREUM:The notion that Solana could outperform Ethereum and draw investors away from ETH has been echoed by numerous writers, bloggers, and even prominent crypto websites. This sentiment reflects the growing interest and optimism surrounding Solana's potential, particularly in comparison to Ethereum. However, it's important to note that Ethereum still holds a dominant position in the market, and any shift in investor sentiment would likely be influenced by various factors, including technological advancements, network usage, and market dynamics.Delay in ETH ETF Approval:The ongoing delay and uncertainty surrounding the approval of an Ethereum ETF proposal may indeed be causing some holders to remain cautious and hesitant to invest in ETH. Historically, ETF approvals in the crypto space have faced delays and regulatory scrutiny, leading to market uncertainty and volatility. Until a clear decision is made regarding the ETH ETF proposal, some investors may choose to adopt a wait-and-see approach, which could impact market sentiment and investment behavior related to Ethereum.Market Cycle:ETH is currently experiencing a consolidation phase, characterized by a one-candle pattern. To confirm a potential shift in trend, ETH must break out of this consolidation pattern. A move beyond the current consolidation range could signify renewed momentum and herald the start of a new trend direction.Capital Rotation:As Ethereum is anticipated to continue ranging for a few more weeks, some retailers may consider investing in other assets that demonstrate more immediate potential for growth.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeEthereum has remained in proximity to the 20-day moving average for the past six weeks, indicating a period of consolidation and sideways movement. Despite potential attempts to establish a swing high, the price has failed to generate significant follow-through, leading to continued consolidation. This suggests a lack of clear directional bias in the market, with buyers and sellers engaged in a tug-of-war scenario.A potential base or immediate support appears to have formed around the $2,900 mark, which has held firm since the recent sell-off. This is further supported by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) approaching the 50 mark, currently pegged at $2,929, indicating a potential bounce.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeEthereum appears poised for further consolidation in the near term, with the price still hovering near the immediate support level around $2,900. Additionally, all the moving averages are positioned above the current price, indicating strong resistance levels. Breaking through these moving averages would require a significant catalyst to drive the price higher, especially considering that they are clustered around the $3,100 mark. The RSI50, which is located close to $3,085, further reinforces this resistance zone, coinciding with the upper boundary of the recent range. Despite these challenges, many market participants remain optimistic about the continuation or commencement of a bull run for Ethereum.Key Inflection Points to monitorSupports:$2,800 as immediate support, followed by $2,216Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $3,300.Bullish Targets:At the moment, the nearest target for ETH is projected at $3,700.Bearish Targets:A break below $2,800 could potentially lead the price down to $2,200."}]}

While other assets have experienced notable uptrends, ATOM has struggled to break out of its long-standing consolidation phase, which began during the bear market. Although it made a recent attempt to break out, this move was short-lived, likely due to the overall negative sentiment in the market following Bitcoin's 23% pullback from its recent all-time high of $73,800. Currently, ATOM remains below the $10 mark, which represents the lower boundary of its consolidation range from the bear market period. This suggests that ATOM may still be finding support at these levels.Causes of SlowPrice ActionGeo-Political Factor:The timing of Cosmos Hub's breakout attempt may have been a significant factor in its lack of sustained momentum. Just as ATOM was poised to make a potential swing high and break out above the $15 mark, the broader cryptocurrency market faced setbacks due to escalating tensions between Iran and Israel. This geopolitical uncertainty likely led to fear and caution among investors, resulting in a negative impact on ATOM's price action and preventing it from achieving a successful breakout.Market Cycle:When a breakout attempt fails to sustain momentum, it often results in a return to a ranging movement, with the price potentially revisiting the lower end of the range. This is a common pattern in trading, where failed breakouts can lead to reversion to previous price levels, especially if the market sentiment remains uncertain or if there are external factors impacting investor confidence.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeAfter a five-week decline, ATOM has returned to its consolidation range, indicating the potential for a prolonged waiting period. Currently trading below the $10 mark and with its Relative Strength Index below 50, the cryptocurrency faces uncertainty. The wide range between $6.76 and $15.69 is significant, representing the consolidation zone since the bear market began in 2022. This range may continue to influence price movements until a clear breakout or catalyst emerges.Despite its sideways movement, entering at the right time could yield significant rewards for short-term and midterm investors, potentially reaching gains of roughly 100%. The nearest target is set at the highest point of the range, around $15.69.Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ATOM is still below 50, indicating the potential for a prolonged consolidation phase. If the RSI breaks above 50, it could signal the emergence of a new market structure, eliminating the likelihood of further declines.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeA bearish channel line is spotted as the price on the daily timeframe respects the support and resistances. Currently, Cosmos Hub is positioned on a swing high as it sits and reacts to the lower trendline of the channel line with roughly 13% - 17% reward in play. Also, on the daily timeframe, its relative strength index is still under 50 and is pegged at $8.87. This price is also the previous break down zone which is considered to be the immediate resistance to the short-term traders/investors. Nonetheless, on the bigger side of things, this coin is considered to be a sleeper play as the reward is high enough for the long term investors.Key Inflection Points to monitorSupports:$8.094 as immediate support, followed by $7.271Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $8.959.Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $8.959, the $10.00 price could be the next target.Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $7.271."}]}

At its core lies the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, powered by the DOT token. This mechanism encourages network security through token staking, a process embraced by the community since the platform's inception. Over time, its staking mechanism has undergone continual refinement, reflecting the community's commitment to enhancing the network. Currently, DOT experiences a steady increase in staked tokens, signaling growing confidence and participation within the ecosystem.Polkadot's Staked Tokens SurgeIn a significant milestone, Polkadot has surpassed the 55% mark for staked tokens, marking a notable progression in its historical trajectory. This surge in staked tokens reflects a burgeoning investor confidence in DOT, driven by the prospect of higher returns. With over 815 million DOT tokens now locked in staking contracts, the network's stability and decentralization are further fortified, aligning seamlessly with its foundational design principles. The active participation in staking plays a pivotal role in upholding the integrity of the Polkadot network, underscoring its significance in ensuring long-term security and reliability.Staking ImplicationsThis milestone holds significant implications for the future trajectory of DOT. With a highly engaged staking community, the network's stability is bolstered, diminishing the risk of potential vulnerabilities. Moreover, the expansion of staking pools offers added incentives for validators, ensuring the network remains vibrant and operates at peak efficiency. However, there are potential concerns regarding the lock-up period for staked tokens and the influence wielded by large stakers, which could potentially lead to centralization issues. These considerations underscore the importance of carefully navigating the balance between network security and decentralization as Polkadot continues to evolve.Final Thoughts: Polkadot's ProgressionPolkadot's recent accomplishment of reaching a staking ratio of 55.68% stands as a remarkable feat, instilling greater investor trust in the platform. With a steadfast staking community fortifying its security and decentralization, the network remains dedicated to advancing the frontier of blockchain interoperability. Nevertheless, a bearish sentiment lingers over DOT's price. The notable decline in its liquidation thresholds is perceived as a key factor contributing to the ongoing downward trend in the token's value."}]}

In October 2021, the network encountered a major security breach, resulting in the theft of over $120 million worth of digital assets. This attack underscored the vulnerabilities present within the network and sparked apprehensions regarding its security. Earlier, in March 2021, NEAR suffered another setback when a bridge connecting NEAR to the Ethereum network was exploited, resulting in a loss of approximately $2 million.Enigmatic Messages Spark SpeculationOn May 8th, this protocol sparked renewed concerns within the crypto community after posting cryptic messages on social media platforms. The enigmatic content, which included a Morse code video and tweets featuring Gothic font phrases like \"Darkness is coming\" and \"reclaim your sovereignty,\" raised questions about the platform's security and stability. This development coincided with the Near Foundation's announcement of staff reductions and a refocused strategy on high-impact goals. The absence of official statements has fueled speculation within the crypto community, with debates ranging from interpreting the messages as mere jokes or teasers for upcoming announcements to potential security vulnerabilities.Addressing NEAR VulnerabilitiesOngoing concerns surrounding potential security vulnerabilities within the Near Protocol pose significant risks to the platform's viability. If left unaddressed, these apprehensions could precipitate adverse outcomes such as diminished investor and user trust, leading to reduced adoption rates, decreased trading volumes and a decline in market capitalization. Furthermore, heightened regulatory scrutiny may ensue, with regulatory bodies interpreting recurring security breaches as indicative of inadequate security measures and governance within the project. Compounding these challenges, the restructuring efforts within the Near Foundation could further complicate the response to potential security breaches. With a reduced workforce and potentially constrained resources, effectively addressing and mitigating such attacks may prove daunting, potentially exacerbating the negative ramifications."}]}

ADA is still in the process of establishing its immediate support, with the 20-day moving average providing resistance. Despite the recent pullback and current price structure, Cardano remains supported on the larger timeframe, particularly on the weekly chart, where it is bolstered by the strongest moving average (MA100) and the 52-week high flip zone.Causes of Sluggish Price ActionPerformance:ADA has indeed experienced a significant decline of over 50% since the sell-off in March. Expecting a rebound to recent highs would necessitate a realistic consolidation period to stabilize the price and rebuild investor confidence.Market Cycle:Cardano is still in the process of establishing its base, despite consolidating for nearly a month now. A break above the $0.50 mark could signify the beginning of a shift in momentum for the cryptocurrency.Moving Averages:As all the moving averages remain in inverted positions (with MA20 below MA50 and MA50 below MA100), the recent attempt by the price to recover and close the gap with the nearest moving average of 20 could signal the start of a reversal. However, staying above the 20-day moving average may prove challenging, given its resistance since the sell-off in March 2024.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeAfter a six-week decline, Cardano's structure offers a clearer perspective on the weekly timeframe as it remains above the previous 52-week high breakout zone. This zone serves as a flip zone, where resistance turns into support, presenting a classic and straightforward setup that signals to long-term and mid-term investors to consider entering the market.A potential 600% reward awaits if the price manages to challenge the previous all-time high at $3.00. Position traders can consider purchasing core shares at a discounted price now, taking advantage of the market's current quietness.An Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern has also been identified on the weekly timeframe (refer to the chart below).

Currently, it resides within the bearish territory of the Darvas Box, indicating that it may take a few days before attempting another breakout.

This outstanding performance makes Solana an appealing choice for developers seeking a robust Layer 1 solution to build decentralized applications. The Solana ecosystem has witnessed remarkable expansion, boasting a multitude of notable dApps such as Wormhole, Jupiter and Pyth Network, all experiencing widespread adoption within the crypto community.Growing User EngagementThe recent surge in activity within Solana's ecosystem marks a significant stride forward, building upon its established history. The uptick in usage observed for meme coins and dApps on Solana reflects interest and adoption within the community. However, it's essential to analyze this increase in transactions within the context of daily active addresses. While transaction volumes are on the rise, the lack of a proportional increase in daily active addresses suggests that some users may be engaging in multiple transactions without generating new addresses.DeFi and NFT ChallengesSolana's DeFi sector faces the looming threat of stagnation, coupled with declining interest in the NFT sector, signaling potential hurdles to its continued growth. The diminishing volumes and TVL in DeFi have the potential to resound across the network, potentially diminishing the demand for SOL tokens. Additionally, the decline in NFT floor values and volumes casts a shadow over sentiment within the Solana ecosystem. While acknowledging these current challenges is crucial, it's equally important to recognize the resilience of these sectors, as they have the potential to rebound, shaping SOL's future trajectory in a more nuanced manner."}]}

However, the subsequent pullback during the Iran/Israel tension in March 2024 led to a significant decline of 50% from the recent sell-off. Currently, Polkadot is in the process of establishing its base as it consolidates within a narrow range of $5.78 to $7.33. This consolidation phase suggests that the cryptocurrency is undergoing a period of price stabilization and indecision among market participants.What's Behind the Sluggish Price Movement?BTC\u2019s correction:During periods of daily declines in Bitcoin ranging from 1% to 5%, the ALT coin markets often face considerable downturns, with prices typically falling by approximately 20%. Consequently, leading up to the Bitcoin Halving, Polkadot experienced a significant drop of around 50% over the past 5 weeks. This illustrates the considerable impact that Bitcoin's price movements can have on the broader cryptocurrency market, including ALT coins like DOT.Relative Strength Index (RSI):The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dipping below 50 often suggests a potential for an extended consolidation period. While it's notable that the price has broken out of the trendline, the lack of significant volume accompanying this move raises concerns about the sustainability of the breakout.Market Cycle:When a breakout attempt loses momentum, it often leads to a return to a ranging pattern, possibly revisiting lower price levels. This is a common occurrence in trading, where unsuccessful breakouts can result in a return to previous price ranges, especially amid uncertain market sentiment or external factors impacting investor confidence. In the case of DOT, there were several attempts to break out of the recent range, but none were successful in sustaining the price movement.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeOver the last 5 weeks, Polkadot has shown little movement despite operating in a ranging market, with volume consistently remaining below average. While potential catalysts could influence overall market sentiment, they might not necessarily attract traders to engage with DOT, given its current market conditions and structure. Presently, DOT appears primed for another swing high as it holds above the retest zone of the previous 52-week high breakout. This represents a classic setup of flip zones, where resistance transitions into support. Disregarding potential future catalysts and focusing solely on the chart setup, mid-term holders could potentially enjoy an 80% reward.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeDespite encountering ongoing difficulties in surpassing the nearest moving average (MA20), DOT's current price is discovering support at a historically significant level of around $5.81. This level signifies robust support amid market volatility. Furthermore, amid notable declines in the broader market over the last two weeks, a bullish divergence in the RSI has become evident. This divergence, coupled with the potential support DOT is endeavoring to establish, could signal a potential reversal in DOT's price trajectory as it disrupts the market structure, potentially forming a higher high structure.Inflection Points to watch out forSupports:$7.23 as immediate support, followed by $5.0Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $7.33.Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $7.33, the $8.5 price could be the next target.Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $5."}]}

Its recent upward momentum saw a gain of around 50%, within the range of $136 to $205. Presently, SOL has entered a sideways phase within this range, aiming to establish immediate support. The $136 level holds historical significance as it represents the flip zone of the previous breakout level, coinciding with the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe.What's Behind the Solid Price Action?General Market Interest:Amidst a subdued general market capitalization and a lack of enthusiasm in BTC, SOL has also experienced a decline in retail interest. Furthermore, the volume over the past 6 weeks has been dwindling. While this might raise initial concerns, it could actually be viewed as a positive development. A decrease in volume implies a reduction in sellers, suggesting a weakening bearish momentum. This scenario could potentially create an opportunity for bulls to regain control of the market in the near future.Delay in ETH ETF Approval:The continuous delay and uncertainty surrounding the approval of an Ethereum ETF proposal may indeed be leading some holders to exercise caution and reluctance to invest in ETH. Until a definitive decision is reached regarding the ETH ETF proposal, certain investors may opt for a wait-and-see strategy, potentially influencing market sentiment and investment patterns related to Ethereum. Consequently, some investors may currently favor the Solana ecosystem over Ethereum as they await clarity on regulatory developments.Market Cycle:Following its robust multi-year breakout at $1.36, SOL surged by approximately 50% before retracing back to this price level. A requisite pullback was necessary before initiating its next upward movement, as evidenced by the chart below.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeOver the past 5 weeks, Solana has exhibited relative stagnation despite navigating a ranging market, with volume consistently remaining below average. However, the foundation it is currently establishing could substantially attract retailers, as the structure potentially indicates a swing high setup while resting on the previous breakout zone at $1.36. This is further reinforced by the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe. Additionally, a classic cup and handle pattern has been identified, with recent candle consolidation confirming the low of the handle pattern. If this setup materializes, there is a potential 40% reward in store.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeWhile SOLANA remains confined within a narrow range of $112.06 to $154.90, there are indications of an inverted Head and Shoulders pattern emerging on the daily timeframe. This pattern suggests a significant stage of consolidation, particularly as the price maintains above the bullish side of the Darvas Box and is supported by a robust moving average (MA100).

The ultimate test lies at Resistance 4, standing firm at $15.110, acting as a substantial barrier to any significant upward price movement.These adjustments reflect the current bearish momentum in PENDLE's price and highlights key levels that traders and investors should monitor closely."}]}

This enhancement ensures higher throughput without compromising security, crucial for supporting Web3 applications across various sectors like gaming and DeFi. Additionally, the recent release of the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) Gray Paper outlines plans to integrate elements of Polkadot and Ethereum, further augmenting the capabilities of the Relay Chain.Moreover, Polkadot's achievement of reaching a record 600,000 unique addresses signifies growing adoption and utilisation of the network. Despite recent bearish sentiment, with DOT experiencing a decline in price, the increase in staking to 55.68% of tokens enhances network stability and decentralisation. These milestones highlight Polkadot's potential as a leading blockchain platform, supported by a thriving ecosystem and robust user participation.Market Movements ExploredPolkadot's native network token, DOT, has had a recent increase of approximately 230% from its October 2023 low to its March 2024 high.After that rise, its price dropped 52%, and it is currently rejecting to the upside the reversion zone (0.61- 0.78 Fibonacci levels) from its October 2023 low, located at $6.78 - $5.37.For the odds of a successful long to improve, the price action must break the current sideways trend and strongly reject the above mentioned reversion zone. This will be achieved once the last relative highs are surpassed at $7.8.Short-Term Price TargetsGiven DOT's price decline and the current price zone, a bullish bounce is possible. In order to capitalise on such a bounce, two zones could be monitored to make entries:The first one would be from $7.3, once the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high is breached and the reversal zone from the October 2023 low is rejected. In addition, this entry ensures that the reversal zone from the last relative high is being broken to the upside.The second one would be at $7.8, with a higher level of confirmation of an upside breakout, but with a higher level of risk in case the price finally decides to pull back, i.e. a higher Stop Loss in case the market decides not to go up.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

Its network native token, PENDLE, serves as an incentive, utility, and governance tool. With a circulating supply of more than 153 million, the last six months surge in PENDLE's price and strategic partnerships has attracted investor attention, driving bullish sentiment.Its Finance's Total Value Locked (TVL) exceeds $4.4 billion, propelled by Eigenlayer's rising popularity and Ethena's stablecoin launch. Eigenlayer's $15 billion TVL and a point program entice users, while Ethena's \"Season 2\" airdrop bolsters Pendle's TVL. Its yield trading offers fixed annual percentage yields but limits potential returns, appealing to both speculators and risk-takers.Pendle also expanded to BNB Chain in the last few months, aiming to capture new users and foster revenue growth, tapping into the burgeoning liquid staking derivatives sector.

During the rally that began in October 2023, QNT attempted to break above the $150 mark but was unsuccessful, affected by the general market sentiment during the pre-BTC and ETH approval week. Another breakout attempt occurred in the last week of March but also failed, likely due to market fears stemming from the Iran/Israel tensions, which led to a market-wide downturn. Currently, QNT is attempting to establish a base, consolidating within a narrow range of $85.13 to $105.85.Causes of Sluggish Price ActionPerformance:QNT has suffered a decline of over 40% since the sell-off last March. Anticipating a rebound to recent highs will require a realistic consolidation period.Market Cycle:As QUANT attempted to establish a new structure by breaking out of the bear market consolidation, its price unfortunately fell back to the lower levels or support level of that consolidation. This suggests that future market participants may need to be prepared for a longer holding period.Moving Averages:With all the moving averages still in inverted positions (MA20 below MA50 and MA50 below MA100), the price's attempt to recover and close the gap with the nearest 20-day moving average may indicate the start of a reversal.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeAfter a six-week decline, QNT's recent price action might signal the beginning of a swing high setup. This potential reversal is suggested by the formation of a reversal candle on the weekly timeframe, supported by a breakout above the short-term trendline resistance.During the October 2023 to March 2024 rally, the price of QNT failed to maintain a higher level, preventing the formation of a solid structure on the weekly timeframe. Unfortunately, the price has now settled at the strongest and immediate support at $85. Nonetheless, the current price is poised for a swing high, offering a promising opportunity for short-term and mid-term investors.Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for QNT is still below 50, suggesting the potential for a prolonged consolidation period. A break above 50 in the RSI could signal the formation of a new structure, reducing the likelihood of lower lows. The RSI50 is pegged at $109, which coincides with the price level where QNT would break above all the moving averages.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeOver the past month, Quant has been attempting to establish its base within a narrow range of $85.13 to $105.85. Although there was an attempt to stay above this range, it was unsustained. Currently, the price has moved out of the trendline and is no longer in the bearish territory of the box. This suggests that risk exposure can be considered at any time within the week to capture potential gains. Traders and investors might consider increasing their allocation once the price confirms a new structure or breaks above the $105 mark.Key Inflection Points to monitorSupports:$92.81 as immediate support, followed by $85.13Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $105.85.Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $105.85, the $116 price could be the next target.Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $85.13."}]}

In contrast, DeFi assets such asPendle and Aaveboth sawnotable declines, with Pendle falling by4.47%and Aave by4.61%. However,1Inch Networkdisplayed a slight positive change,increasing by 0.28%.SinceEthereum (ETH) showed a slight decline and as a primary asset in DeFi, its performance could be influencing DeFi tokens negatively. The notable declines inPendle and Aave might be a reflectionof this influence. In contrast, theslight positive movement of 1Inch Network could indicate relative stability or a lesser impact from negative market trendscompared to Pendle and Aave.Thecryptocurrency marketis currently experiencing a significantdownturn.Despite recent bullish events like the disclosure of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo holding spot Bitcoin ETFs, the market remains bearish. Data from Coinglass indicates that bothBTC and ETH have seen more inflows than outflows, yetliquidations remain low, suggesting a lack of aggressive selling pressure.Ethereum's struggles are compounded by the aftermath of the Dencun upgrade, which, despite its intention to reduce transaction fees and enhance scalability, has led to concerns overEthereum becoming inflationary again.The upgrade's unintended consequence of increasing the total supply has contributed to the ongoing bearish trend. Furthermore, thelikelihood of the SEC denying applications for Ethereum spot ETFs due to regulatory ambiguities and ongoing investigationsadds to the negative sentiment. The broader market sentiment is also influenced bymacroeconomic factors such as the recent U.S. inflation report, which, despite showing signs of easing, has not been sufficient to alleviate the pessimismin the crypto markets.Bitcoin's price, though it briefly surged past $64,000 due to reduced inflation hopes,has failed to maintain upward momentum, mirroring the overall market trend. This convergence of regulatory uncertainty, inflation concerns and specific technical issues within Ethereum has led to a market-wide decline.InAave\u2019s case, its decline can be attributed to a combination of broader market downturns and specific challenges faced by its own initiatives, such as therecently announced Lens Network L2 leveraging Matter Labs' ZK Stack. While the Lens Network aims to transform web3 social applications with a hybrid validium and volition Layer 2 design, enhancing scalability and reducing fees, itsambitious scope introduces several uncertainties.Additionally, despite Lens Network's promising features, including gasless and signless transactions for improved user onboarding, theactual impact and adoption rate of these innovations remain speculative. Furthermore, theincreased transaction activity and steady user growth reported by Dune Analytics might not be sufficient to counterbalance market apprehensionsabout execution and scalability in the face of competition and regulatory challenges.Similarly,Pendle's decline, despite its surge in TVL to $4.4 billion, can be attributed to several factors. Therapid growth driven by Eigenlayer's popularity and Ethena's stablecoin launch has attracted speculative interest, particularly in leveraging farming points for high yields. However, this speculative fervourintroduces significant volatility and risk, which can lead to sharp price correctionsas traders and investors react to broader market dynamics and short-term profit-taking. Additionally, thefixed yield offerings, while attractive for security, may not appeal to those seeking the potentially higher returnsof more volatile investments. Themarket's broader downturn, driven by macroeconomic uncertainties and bearish sentiments in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, also exerts downward pressureon Pendle.Finally, therecent increase in the market capitalization and price of 1Inch Network can be attributed to its strategic collaboration with Baanx and Mastercard to launch a Web3 crypto debit card.This product not onlybroadens the utility of 1Inch tokens by enabling seamless crypto-to-fiat transactions at physical and online merchants but also positions the platform at the forefront of integrating traditional finance with decentralised finance.The ability towithdraw cash from compatible ATMs and compatibility with popular mobile payment services like ApplePay and GooglePay enhances its appeal to a broader user base, including those who might be new to cryptocurrencies. This development has likelyboosted investor confidence, anticipating increased adoption and usage of 1Inch tokensas the platform expands its reach and utility. Theendorsement by well-known entities like Mastercard further legitimises 1Inch Networkin the eyes of both retail and institutional investors, contributing to the positive price movement."}]}

A necessary pullback occurred during the last week of December 2023, but the price quickly recovered and reached a new high in the 1st quarter of this year. However, a sharp decline followed as the general market experienced a bloodbath in March 2024, exacerbated by the Iran/Israel tensions. AVAX suffered a rough 50% decline during this sell-off and has been establishing a base, consolidating for over a month within the range of $29.38 to $39.37.Causes of Steady Price ActionGeneral Market Stance:Bitcoin is commonly referred to as the pioneer and leader in the cryptocurrency market, earning it the moniker \"the mother of all charts.\" As a result, the price movements and trends seen in Bitcoin's chart often exert a significant influence on the behavior of other cryptocurrencies, prompting many to mirror its patterns.Market Cycle:Following an estimated 600% surge since the October 2023 rally, a correction is deemed necessary before AVA initiates its next upward movement.Relative Strength Index:The relative strength index (RSI) of AVAX has remained stable since the sell-off, consistently hovering around the middle line or the 50 mark. This typically suggests that the sell-off is merely a healthy pullback, necessary before its next rally.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeSince Avalanche broke out above the multi-year high resistance level at $30, it experienced a follow-through and a subsequent retest during the post-BTC ETF approval period. Despite a sharp decline influenced by general market fear stemming from Israel/Iran tension, AVAX is currently positioned in a favorable resting zone, sitting on the multi-year high flip zone where resistance has turned into support. This type of price action sets the stage for a potential swing high setup, particularly when the price has been consolidating to attract more investors for its next upward movement.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeAvalanche has been observed consolidating within a 30% range over the past 33 days. Despite two attempts to establish a new structure, they were unsuccessful, coinciding with a general market downturn, particularly evident in Bitcoin's recent sideways movement.

Conversely,1INCHlagged behind with theleast growth, experiencing a decrease.However, AAVEis the token with thebiggest TVL amount.Despite a downturn in its market cap,Aave's recent surge in TVL can be attributed to the announcement regarding the Lens Network L2. This development highlights the network's dedication to transforming and scaling DeFi. With the introduction of a Layer 2 network tailored for web3 social applications, Lens Network aims tomeet the demanding transaction throughput needs of mainstream consumer applications while maintaining cost-effectiveness. The incorporation ofgasless and signless transactions further simplifies user onboarding, potentially attracting a broader user base. Furthermore, the endorsement from Matter Labs underscores Lens Network's credibility and its potential to overcome blockchain's scaling challenges, paving the way for widespread adoption in the DeFi space.Pendle Finance's remarkable surge in TVL to over $4.6 billioncan be attributed to several key factors. Firstly, the project has capitalized on therising popularity of Eigenlayerand liquidity restaking projects, which have amassed significant TVL themselves. Eigenlayer's TVL of $15 billion has attracted considerable attention, and Pendle's offering ofleverage trading and acquisition of Eigenlayer points has enticed users seeking to amplify their exposure and yield opportunities. Additionally, this network\u2019sintroduction of a new stablecoin called Ethena, coupled with its airdrop points distribution strategy, has further boosted interest and participation.

While this move aims to attract new users, especially those from traditional finance backgrounds, it may have temporarily impacted the TVL of 1Inch Network. Thefocus on providing users with greater flexibility and accessibility to their assets through the debit card could have prompted some users to withdraw funds from the platform, leading to a decrease in TVL.However, this initiative reflects a broader strategy aimed at expanding the platform's reach beyond the DeFi community and could ultimately contribute to long-term growth and increased TVL as more users engage with 1inch Network's ecosystem through alternative avenues."}]}

These will be higher once the price has definitively rejected the $92 level which corresponds to the 0.13 Fibonacci level from the ATH, and surpassed the 0.23 Fibonacci level from its double top.

This breakout was supported by two moving averages (MA20 and MA100) and accompanied by slightly above-average volume, successfully pushing the price above the $65,000 mark. Currently, BTC is holding above the bullish side of the box, with mid-term support provided by the 50-day moving average.Technical Analysis InsightsBitcoin Dominance experienced a smooth rally over the past 5 days, increasing by 7% after breaking above the $2.4 billion mark. This rally could be attributed to the recent announcement by FTX, the bankrupt crypto exchange, which revealed a plan to repay approximately 98% of its creditors, potentially injecting new momentum into the crypto market.As BTC Dominance continues to rise, Bitcoin is poised to potentially start its new leg up and challenge the recent all-time high price of $73,800. This upward momentum is also supported by the recent release of the United States' CPI data, which indicated a slower rate of inflation in April.Finally, both the weekly and daily timeframes confirm a break of the downward trendline in Bitcoin's price. Although it may consolidate for a while, the fact that it has broken out of the trend could entice retail investors and traders to hop in.Potential Weekend Outcomes1. BTC Dominance could consolidate above the $2.5 billion mark as volume remains low despite its 5-day rally. Although the relative strength index (RSI) indicates potential momentum as it approaches overbought levels, this may not be strongly supported by general market participants due to typically low trading volume on weekends.2. For Bitcoin's price over the weekend, expecting very narrow volatility is realistic, as there are no significant catalysts seen across the board to drive the price wildly. A projected 4% to 5% move can be expected, with the closest resistance pegged at $68,000.3. Lastly, Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) has finally surpassed the middle mark for the first time since the last sell-off. There were several previous attempts to stay above the bullish side of momentum, but these were unsustained. This time, it could potentially signal the start of a shift in momentum.SnapshotBTC Dominance has successfully retested the $2.38 billion mark and started a short rally, reaching up to the $2.6 billion mark.Bitcoin is on the verge of testing its recent break above the $65,000 price level, supported by the midterm 50-day moving average.Bitcoin's momentum might not be fully evident yet, but it could shift soon, especially as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 55. As long as the price stays above the $65,000 mark, its next rally could happen at any time.Weekend and Monday OutlookLower volatility is anticipated over the weekend as Bitcoin's nearest resistance is situated near the $68,000 mark. A projected 10% volatility is expected for both the bulls and the bears in case any catalyst arises, as Bitcoin's price is currently ranging between $61,000 and $65,000.Forecast FlashAs BTCDom continues to slowly move upward, BTC might continue to stall. Bitcoin to break above $66,769 might be a good start of the momentum."}]}

This allows users to trade interest-bearing assets as principal and future interest payments. Its native token, PENDLE, is used for incentives, utility, and governance. Its price has seen a significant price surge powered by strategic partnerships in the past six months, attracting investor attention and driving bullish sentiment.Pendle's Total Value Locked (TVL) exceeded $5 billion during April, driven by the popularity of Eigenlayer and Ethena's stablecoin launch, and it has recently reached the $10 billion mark in trading volume. Expanding to the BNB Chain, it tapped into the liquid staking derivatives sector, offering up to 82% annualised yields on ETH and its derivatives, contributing to nearly 300% growth in locked tokens even during a bear market.Featured Cryptocurrency of the Week: PENDLEThis Week's Breakthroughs:This past Friday, May 10th, Eigenlayer's EIGEN token-claim process began. However, it faced backlash for not enabling the transfer of tokens until a future date, regional exclusions such as US, China and Canada,, and VPN bans.Criticisms around the point-based reward system that Eigen Layer uses and unrealistic expectations that this created, have raised doubts about its effectiveness. This controversy could impact Pendle, which shares a similar user base than EIGEN, potentially diminishing trust and participation in Pendle\u2019s yield trading activities.Technical AnalysisRecent Price MovementsPENDLE is currently and since the beginning of this week having a notorious rebound to the upside, in which it has just rejected not only the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from its March 2024 low, but it has also just surpassed the 0.23 Fibonacci level from its ATH, improving the probabilities of a new uptrend forming, breaking the one it currently has since mid-April.Future PerspectivesGiven that the price of PENDLE has breached the 0.23 Fibonacci level and is currently attempting to break the descending channel (marked in yellow), it could effectively break the channel, leading it to test at least the price zone of its last relative high, which is near the 0.38 Fibonacci level at $5.26.In case the 0.38 Fibonacci level from the ATH and the last relative high are breached, then the reversion zone from $6.13 could be reached with a higher probability.The entry to attempt a long towards $5.26 - $6.13 - $6.75 is active from $4.8.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesAave (AAVE):AAVE had a clear rebound from the 0.13 Fibonacci level price zone from its 2024 High and is currently testing the $88 zone which coincides with the 0.61 Fibonacci level from its 2023 low. A breakout of this zone would increase the probability of breaking the downtrend that has been in place since March 2024.1Inch Network (1INCH):1INCH has also just regained the 0.13 Fibonacci level from its 2024 High. A break of the $0.4 level would significantly increase the likelihood that it could visit the $0.6 area and perhaps even reach new yearly highs."}]}

This move trailed and eventually spiked the price back to $65,000. Despite short-term fears in the general market as the price stayed below this strong moving average for three days, Bitcoin showed resilience near the $60,000 level, holding steady before rising 7% on May 15, 2024. This price movement is seen as a bullish signal, breaking above the short-term trendline that had persisted over the past two months.What's Behind the Upward Price Movement?Post Halving:Despite Bitcoin's somewhat sluggish performance following the Halving event over a month ago, the price may mimic historical movements, as BTC typically consolidates for an extended period with a 30% pullback before initiating its next leg up.Market position:Last week\u2019s price action showed a significant shift when Bitcoin made a 7% upward move in one day, potentially signaling the start of a trend reversal.General Market Sentiment:The fear of sell-offs around the halving period is losing strength, and Bitcoin ETFs have seen increased inflows, indicating a rise in demand.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeBitcoin has finally broken out of the short-term trendline resistance for the first time in the past six weeks. This breakout occurred last week when BTC rose by 7%, with significant volume confirming the potential reversal of the trend.The weekly timeframe indicates that Bitcoin's price is currently staying within the bullish territory of the Darvas Box.

Bitcoin's price is holding above the $67,000 mark, which also signifies that it is above the previous all-time high of $64,000.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeAn inverse head and shoulders pattern emerged last week, materializing as Bitcoin broke above the $67,000 price level. This bold move could potentially attract more investors and traders, as it marks the first time BTC has stayed above all the moving averages since the sell-off last March. Additionally, rumors about FTX, the bankrupt crypto-exchange, revealing a plan to repay approximately 98% of its creditors, could inject significant momentum into the crypto market. This development supports the idea of Bitcoin challenging its recent all-time high, potentially driving more inflows into the market.Inflection Points to watch out forSupports:$60,180 as immediate support, followed by $58,341.Resistance:BTC needs to break above $73,800 to confirm its next leg up.Bullish Targets:A break above $60,180 could potentially lead the price to $81,800.Bearish Targets:Any catastrophic event capable of driving BTC's price below $60,000 has the potential to induce chaos across the entire market, potentially leading BTC to revisit $50,000."}]}

Over the weekend, ETH maintained its position above the 20-day moving average, potentially signaling a trend reversal. This development is significant as Ethereum has struggled to break above this moving average since the sell-off in March 2024.What's Behind the Price Drag?ETH ETF Approval:The pending approval of an ETH ETF could potentially contribute to Ethereum's lack of momentum and enthusiasm among retail traders and investors.Market Stance:As Ethereum finally breaches the 20-day moving average for the first time in the past two months, it is still currently experiencing a sideways environment on both short and longer timeframes.Capital Rotation:As Ethereum is anticipated to continue ranging for a few more weeks, some retailers may consider investing in other assets that demonstrate more immediate potential for growthTechnical analysis on a Weekly timeframeThe 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe confirms its potential as Ethereum\u2019s price currently stays above it. This suggests that, on the higher and longer timeframes, Ethereum\u2019s structure remains intact and is poised for a potential swing high.Ethereum's Relative Strength Index (RSI) has remained above the middle line, indicating a healthy pullback and bullish consolidation.

Additionally, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is finally above the middle mark since the sell-off last March, which could signify the start of a shift in momentum.Inflection Points to watch out forSupports:$2,944 as immediate support, followed by $2,821.Resistance:A breakout above $3,302 has the potential to lead the price towards consolidation around the $3,552 price level.Bullish Targets:The target for a swing high could be approximately $3,752. Any movement beyond that level might result in a longer holding period, as Ethereum could potentially enter another short-term consolidation phase.Bearish Targets:Falling below the $2,808 mark could likely push the price down to around $2,200."}]}

This raises the tension in the Middle East, which has already been hit by the conflict unleashed after the Hamas attack on Israel last October, which could trigger a larger scale conflict given the support of powers such as China and Russia to Iran, and its counterpart of the United States and Western Europe with Israel.Financial InsightsUS core inflation reported by the Fed remained at 0.3% month-over-month during April, decelerating to 3.4% y/y, and raising the spectre of a possible future interest rate hike.It is worth noting that this is another step in the direction of a soft landing, not to mention that the U.S. employment market continues with a good level of activity and declining unemployment claims reports, despite having had a weak NFP report.This generates confidence in much of the market that the U.S. economy remains stable in the short term, making it possible for the stock market to continue its uptrend, and with it Bitcoin and the altcoin market.Nevertheless, it is important to mention that there are macroeconomic variables that are of concern about the U.S. economy, these are mainlyThe level of monetary issuance that the government has been maintaining, which some believe is to keep the economy active and the stock market at good levels during this election year.The level of credit card debt that the average American currently has, which could become a serious problem if the level of employment and purchasing power of the average American falls.The rise in general and housing prices within the country, which do not seem to be easing even in this context of a gradual decline in inflation.Market DynamicsThe S&P500 continues to break all-time highs and comfortably surpassed the 5300 level on Wednesday, May 15th. Currently, and having started the week following the positive April inflation announcement, it seems to show no signs of weakness or correction, which augurs a possible move towards 5380-5500 points.SPX500/USD 1D ChartIn addition to this, the EUR-USD forex pair has recorded its 5th week of upward recovery, coinciding with the weakness that its counterpart DXY (US dollar strength index) has been showing during the same period.Bitcoin has closed a week of significant recovery, where it has rejected the 60k resistance, a sign that there is still upside strength left this year to try to recover the 70k and seek new highs in the short-medium term.Finally, and in line with the stock market and the crypto market, Gold and metals have returned to the upward path after a few days in which they threatened to reverse the strong rise they had been having.Market Projections and Technical OutlookGoing specifically to the cryptocurrency market, Reality ended up winning out over the views of the perma-bears as Bitcoin has scored a strong recovery week of +7.79%after having been teetering around the 57k-60k area for a few days when it looked like there would be a deeper correction and continuation of the downtrend.The highlight of this is that its price action has rejected to the upside two key zones, on the one hand the $57400 area which coincides with the 0.78 Fibonacci level from the November 2021 ATH, and on the other hand it has recovered and bounced at $60400, where is located the 0.38 Fibonacci level from its January 2024 low, both signals that strongly increase the statistical probability that a bullish scenario could develop in the short-medium term.BTC/USDT 1D ChartCurrently its price action is once again retesting the reversal zone from its ATH (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) between $67,200 and $70,100.In case the price does not generate a new rejection of the 0.61 Fibonacci level from the ATH, it could more likely head to the 70k zone, where it will be decided whether Bitcoin can: break the level and try to reach new highs in the short term or continue to sideways and enter the downtrend again and form a new market ceiling."}]}

Following the post BTC-ETF approval, NEAR saw another 250% increase over six weeks, breaking out of its long-term consolidation. It experienced a 50% decline during the sell-off last March, but the multi-year high level pegged at $5.50 provided strong support as the price bounced off, confirming a healthy pullback. Currently, NEAR is attempting to establish another higher-high structure.What's Behind the Steady Upward Movement?General Market Sentiment:When Bitcoin experiences daily rises ranging from 1% to 5%, the altcoin markets often witness significant upside, with prices increasing by roughly 20%.Market Stance:During the 50% decline over the past six weeks, NEAR stayed above the $5.00 mark, which historically was the previous multi-year high. This level has now turned into immediate support, exemplifying a classic flip zone where resistance becomes support.The 20-day Moving Average Support:The price is currently trailing on the fastest moving average, set to a 20-day on the weekly timeframe. This indicates a very healthy trend for midterm and long-term investors and traders.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeFollowing a five-week downturn, NEAR displayed a substantial reversal or swing high setup as it bounced back after touching the 20-day moving average. This rebound is also supported by the previous breakout zone pegged at the $5.50 price level.Currently, NEAR is challenging the previous high of the rally as it attempts to break above the $8.248 mark. If it succeeds, this breakout will create a higher-high structure, confirming a rally ahead.Lastly, NEAR's relative strength index (RSI) on the weekly timeframe remains overly bullish, never dipping below the 50 mark. Since the sell-off last March, the RSI has stayed above the middle line, confirming a very healthy pullback.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeNEAR\u2019s rejection from the recent high of $9.036 was severe, resulting in a 53% decline over 29 days. However, the price found support at the strongest moving average, staying above it during the sell-off last April, driven by fears surrounding the Iran/Israel tension. Since then, the 100-day moving average has continued to rise, with the price trailing it before eventually taking off. This movement has confirmed that all the moving averages are now aligned in the right order: the 20-day moving average above the 50-day moving average, and the 50-day moving average above the 100-day moving average. Such a structure indicates a normal and healthy uptrend across all timeframes.Inflection Points to watch out for:Supports:The immediate support for the price is at $6.8, with subsequent support at $5.21.Resistance:Surpassing the $8.87 mark could drive the price up to $11.13.Bullish Targets:As the attempt of breaking out is getting closer, a farther target is set at $11.3.Bearish Targets:If the price fails to breakout, the price could potentially visit the 20-day moving average of the weekly timeframe pegged at $5.57."}]}

Currently, AAVE remains within this range, having experienced a 50% pullback during the recent sell-off last March. However, despite this pullback, the price has stayed above the bearish side of the Darvas Box, indicating positive sentiment among long-term investors and traders.Reasons behind the sluggish priceBTC\u2019s correction:When BTC experiences daily declines ranging from 1% to 5%, the ALT coin markets often witness significant downturns, with prices falling by roughly 20%. Therefore, during BTC's pullback prior to the Halving, AAVE has experienced a substantial 53% drop over the past few weeks, including a dramatic 40% sell-off over a consecutive 3-day period.Market Structure and Timing:When AAVE failed to stay above the Darvas Box, it entered a longer consolidation period. There were two attempts to break above the $128 mark. The first attempt coincided with the pre-BTC ETF approval period, a time when the general market was very cautious, leading to no follow-throughs during and after the event. The second attempt showed more promise, as the price stayed near the $128 level. However, it was ultimately unsuccessful due to general market fears stemming from the Iran/Israel tensions, which resulted in a widespread sell-off across the cryptocurrency market.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeDespite yesterday\u2019s massive move, AAVE remains within its immediate consolidation range, with resistance looming at the $100.10 mark. This indicates that, although there was significant price movement, the cryptocurrency has yet to break out of its current trading range and overcome this key resistance level.AAVE has potentially established its immediate support, with the price repeatedly reacting above the $80 mark. Yesterday\u2019s significant move could challenge its short-term resistance pegged at $100, indicating a possible upward momentum if this resistance is successfully breached.On a longer perspective, AAVE presents significant upside potential as it is currently trading at a discounted price. Moreover, the general market has yet to fully recognize the previous rally as a bull rally, suggesting that there is much more to come in the next few months. If the price were to return to around $600 levels, there is a potential for a 600% upside.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeAAVE\u2019s recent price action suggests a potential break above its immediate range as the price approaches the $100 mark. Yesterday's strong and bullish candle could drive short-term investors and traders to participate in its next leg up. Additionally, the breakout of the relative strength index above the middle line may confirm a shift in momentum. While the price still needs to stay above $100, which is the immediate resistance, once it successfully breaks through, a trend-following approach can be executed for long-term investors and traders.Inflection Points to watch out for:Supports:The immediate support for the price is at $88.13, with subsequent support at $72.98.Resistance:Surpassing the $100 mark could drive the price up to $117.57.Bullish Targets:As the price is currently challenging the resistance, its next target would be around $117.57Bearish Targets:If the price fails to break above $100, expect price to pullback at $84."}]}

Set to launch in May, the ASI token will consolidate the digital assets of these three decentralised AI protocols, potentially achieving a market capitalization of $7.5 billion. This merger aims to democratise AI development, accelerate investments in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and challenge the dominance of large tech companies. The unification under ASI is expected to enhance security, privacy, and transparency in AI applications.This new integration of 3 of the most famous AI cryptocurrencies, will drive new resources and collaborations towards decentralised AI development. By combining their expertise and technologies, these protocols aim to establish new standards in the industry, ensuring robust and secure AI solutions free from centralised control.Moreover, this initiative reflects the growing interest and potential in the AI sector, further underscored by reports of significant investments, such as the proposed $40 billion Saudi Arabian fund for AI development.Market Movements ExploredOCEAN has had a sharp rise of over 500% from its October 2023 low to its 2024 high, but this is not to mention the aggressive +1330% it scored from its November 2022 ATL.After this steep rise and reaching the $1.67 level, its price retreated to the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from its ATL, i.e. to the $0.7135 area.Having reached this area, it made a bounce to the upside in rejecting the mentioned reversal zone. This increased the probability of a bearish continuation for the OCEAN price. In fact, it was a clear sign of bullish strength.It is always necessary to see how the price behaves when reaching a major reversal zone like the one mentioned above, and in case of a rejection in the opposite direction, the probability of having a successful trade in that direction is greatly improved.In our case, OCEAN's rejection of this zone took the price to the current zone above $1.00 and the 0.38 Fibonacci level from the ATH, located at $0.814.Short-Term Price TargetsSince the price of OCEAN is already above the 0.38 Fibonacci level, a next entry could be when it breaks the resistance at $1.08, where its last two relative highs are located, i.e. enter long from $1.1.In case there is a pullback in price, an entry could be sought at $0.83, i.e. above the reversal zone taken from the last relative low.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

However, FTM faced a 50% pullback as the general market corrected at the end of the first quarter of this year. Currently, Fantom is attempting to establish a new structure, having broken out above its 30-day consolidation range, and is likely to retest the flip zone levels soon.What's Behind the Steady Upward Movement?Ethereum ETF Approval:Rumors about the approval of an ETH ETF have been circulating widely, leading to a rapid 9% increase in Ethereum's price within approximately 20 minutes on Monday. This surge highlights the significant impact that regulatory news and speculation can have on market sentiment and price movements in the cryptocurrency space.Market Stance:During the 50% decline over the past six weeks, Fantom (FTM) has managed to break out of its short-term trendline, indicating a potential shift in momentum. This breakout suggests that FTM might be gearing up for a reversal, potentially attracting investors and traders looking for recovery and upward movement.The 20-day Moving Average Support:The price of Fantom (FTM) is currently trailing on the fastest moving average, set to the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe. This positioning indicates a very healthy trend for midterm and long-term investors and traders, suggesting sustained upward momentum and stability.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeFantom (FTM) is currently challenging the middle line of the Darvas Box, which is considered the bullish side of the range. The general market sentiment, particularly influenced by the anticipation of the ETH ETF approval, could potentially drive a spike up to the bullish side of the Darvas Box. This move would signal strong bullish momentum and could attract more investors and traders, further supporting the upward trend.Considering the current status of the moving averages on the FTM chart, it's noteworthy that the nearest moving average (MA20) has recently been respected over the past few weeks. Should the price manage to stay consistently above this moving average, it could serve as a significant indicator of a potential steady uptrend. Therefore, closely monitoring the price action around the MA20 level could provide valuable insights into the future direction of Fantom. This level will be crucial for traders and investors to determine the strength and sustainability of the current trend.It's also worth considering the status of Fantom's Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has consistently remained above the 50 mark since the sell-off started last March. This suggests a persistent underlying bullish sentiment despite FTM's 50% decline. The RSI's resilience above 50 indicates that the recent pullback could be viewed as a healthy correction within a broader uptrend rather than a bearish reversal.Furthermore, the February rally saw FTM break out above its multi-year high, and it is now sitting above this previous breakout zone. This level, previously a significant resistance, has now turned into a robust support zone, reinforcing the bullish outlook. The price staying above this breakout zone, combined with a strong RSI, supports the notion that FTM remains in a bullish trend. This scenario suggests that FTM has the potential to resume its upward trajectory, making it an asset to watch closely for further bullish moves.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeDuring the recent bullish surge across the general market, FANTOM's attempt to break above the middle line of the Darvas Box on the daily timeframe faced rejection, as indicated by the candlestick patterns. However, there has been a notable shift in FANTOM's overall trend since last week, marked by a breakout above a key trendline. Additionally, this breakout aligns with the breach of its immediate consolidation range, centered around the $0.7582 level.While these developments suggest the potential formation of a new higher low structure for FANTOM, it's likely that a longer holding period will be necessary before the price can embark on its next significant upward movement. This consolidation phase is crucial for establishing a solid foundation and allowing the market to absorb recent gains. Monitoring is essential on the $0.7582 support level and the boundaries of the Darvas Box, to assess the likelihood of FANTOM's price making a sustained upward move in the near future.Inflection Points to watch out forSupports:$0.7582 is the immediate support level, with $0.6454following closely behind.Resistance:$1 is the next immediate resistance considering this is a whole number resistance, followed by $1.13Bullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period, is set at $1.00.Bearish Targets:A break below $0.75 could potentially lead the price back to the Darvas Box and could eventually lead the price down to $0.55."}]}

Even during the pre-BTC ETF approval period, PENDLE remained resilient, avoiding significant setbacks and forming higher highs in an attempt to reach new peaks. Its most recent rally saw a remarkable 230% increase, although this momentum was disrupted by the IRAN/ISRAEL tensions, which triggered a broad market downturn.Currently, PENDLE has found immediate support around the $4.00 mark, demonstrating a bounce-back last week.

This indicates a short-term period of consolidation and suggests that the price may soon challenge its recent all-time high.Ethereum ETF Approval:Rumors about the approval of an ETH ETF have been circulating widely, causing Ethereum's price to jump by 9% within about 20 minutes on Monday. This surge underscores the significant impact that regulatory news and speculation can have on market sentiment and price movements in the cryptocurrency space.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeWhile the general market hasn\u2019t considered the previous rally as the definitive bull run of this year, PENDLE has significant potential for future rewards once the bull run officially starts. Analyzing its price action reveals that PENDLE consistently respects the 20-day moving average, the fastest moving average in the general market. This indicates that its pullbacks and rebounds are closely aligned with this average, suggesting a healthy and responsive trend.Another notable aspect is that PENDLE typically does not undergo long consolidation periods during pullbacks. On a larger timeframe, it has breached and remained on the bullish side of the Darvas Box. This is a positive indicator for traders and investors, particularly long-term holders, as it signifies sustained upward momentum and market confidence.Finally, its relative strength index held above the mid range which connotes a potential continuous of the bullish momentum.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeAmidst the significant declines in the general market since March, PENDLE had a few days where its price dipped below the strongest moving average. However, it quickly recovered and remained above the 100-day moving average, potentially shaking out some retail investors. During this period, the price initiated a swing high from $3.88 to $6.53, marking almost a 70% increase in one full trading week. Currently, it may undergo a narrow pullback before challenging the recent all-time high of $7.53.Inflection Points to watch out forSupports:$5.91 is the immediate support level, with $3.88 following closely behind.Resistance:The nearest resistance is pegged at $7.53, this is the recent all-time high price.Bullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period, is set at $7.53.Bearish Targets:A break below $3.88 could potentially lead the price down to $2.31."}]}

The platform uses the Lachesis protocol to provide fast transaction speeds and near-instant finality, making it an attractive option for developers and users alike. Fantom's ecosystem is rapidly growing, supporting various applications and projects that enhance its value proposition.Recent optimism surrounding the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC has fueled market excitement also around the Fantom ecosystem. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts have increased their odds of the ETFs approval from 25% to 75%, citing renewed regulatory optimism. This sentiment shift has positively impacted Ethereum and its associated projects, with significant price surges observed in the market.Combining Fantom's technical strengths with the bullish market sentiment driven by potential Ethereum ETF approvals, and given that the DeFi landscape is evolving and regulatory clarity improving, Fantom stands out as a promising project with significant long-term growth potential.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsFTM has rallied more than 600% from its October 2023 low to its 2024 High, reaching the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) traced from its High 1, which is between $1.1 and $1.35.After testing that zone, the price made an almost 55% retracement to the reversal zone from the last low at $0.66, and used that zone as a strong support to push higher again.Looking closely at the Fibonacci retracement plotted from the 2024 High, we can see that the price action has already surpassed the 0.38 level and was close to touching the 0.61 level.If the price continues to move downwards, it is important that it does not fall beyond its last support at the $0.66 price zone, otherwise we could see a drop towards the $0.53 or $0.36 price zone.Short-Term Price TargetsLooking more in detail within the 4-hour chart, FTM price was close to reaching the 0.61 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high, and is currently having a pullback towards the $0.843 price zone. In case of staying above this zone, which coincides with the 0.38 level of the retracement from the last high, a first bullish entry with tight risk management could be made.If the price does not respect this zone, it could continue down towards $0.77, where the reversal zone from the last high is located, which could be a good support for the price and a key level to attempt a bullish trade.In the event that the price breaks below the reversal zone between $0.77 and $0.71, it could retrace back to the $0.66 price zone which is currently the main support for the price as mentioned above. This would be the ideal area to attempt a long trade.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

With a focus on interoperability and advanced technologies like federated learning, Fetch.ai aims to revolutionise various industries, fostering an autonomous economy where agents collaborate securely.The paradigm-shifting crypto news this week surrounding the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs made public on Monday presents a significant market catalyst. If approved, it could positively impact sentiment towards AI-focused cryptocurrencies like Fetch.ai\u2019s native token, FET. Investors may view the approval as a sign of regulatory acceptance and increased mainstream adoption, potentially bolstering demand for altcoins.Another recent event was the news about the creation of ASI, consolidating Fetch.ai, SingularityNet, and Ocean Protocol, introducing a significant development in AI-focused altcoins. ASI's goal to democratise AI development and challenge tech giants' dominance could impact FET's position in the market. The integration into ASI may enhance Fetch.ai's ecosystem and market presence, potentially driving increased investor interest and market capitalization into it.Market Movements ExploredFET has had an impressive rise of over 1600% from its October 2023 low to reach its ATH in April 2024.After this bull run, its price dropped 55% to touch $1.65, where the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from its February 2024 low begins.Immediately after touching the reversal zone, the price rebounded strongly and used the $1.85 area as main support.Currently, it has just re-tested the $2.6 price zone which has constituted a strong resistance, where it has gone up twice and rejected it downwards.If this zone is surpassed, the price could go again to the reversal zone from its ATH between $2.76 and $3.07, where special care should be taken since the Market Maker usually sets all kinds of traps for retail investors.Short-Term Price TargetsSince the price of FET has already moved away from the optimal entry levels of $1.9 (riskier) and $2.06 (after breaching the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the ATH), three price levels could be considered to attempt a bullish entry in FET:The main one would be at $2.62 once the $2.6 resistance is surpassed, which would have as first target the reversal zone from ATH.In case of a pullback to the 0.38-0.61 levels from the last low, entries could be attempted at $2.34 - $2.44, but it should be after the price respects those levels for safety, and it would be crucial to use proper risk management.If a scenario occurs where the price breaks down to the $2.316 level, it is more likely to drop to the $2.04 level. Should this occur and that price zone is rejected to the upside, a long trade could be attempted from $2.06, as it would be above the 0.23 FIbonacci level from the ATH, and above the 1.27 retracement level from the last high.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

The lowest price recorded for Kaspa (KAS) was $0.000171 on May 26, 2022, nearly two years ago. The current price is an astonishing 81,751.77% higher than this all-time low. Since the start of the 2023 rally, KASPA has consistently hit new all-time highs. A notable pattern in its behavior is the tendency to undergo prolonged consolidations before making higher high structures. Its most recent consolidation lasted roughly 80 trading days before it surged to its current all-time high of $0.1896.What's Behind the Steady Upward Movement?Market Technical Structure:During the general market decline that began last March, KASPA experienced a roughly 50% drop. However, it quickly established support at the $0.10 mark, which coincided with the previous low of its recent swing high.20-Day Moving Average Trail:KASPA\u2019s steady upward movement is objectively reflected in its 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe, as the price has closely followed this indicator since October 2022. This suggests a consistent and healthy uptrend, providing confidence to mid-term and long-term investors.Relative Strength Index (RSI):Since the start of KASPA\u2019s uptrend, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has consistently remained on the bullish side, never dipping below the middle line on the weekly timeframe. This indicates a sustained bullish momentum and suggests strong long-term potential for the coin.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeKASPA experienced an extended pullback over an 8-week period. However, last week it finally broke out of its immediate trendline resistance, positioning itself for a potential swing high that could challenge its recent all-time high price of $0.1896.Based on observations, KASPA typically undergoes extended periods of consolidation before forming new higher structures. Currently, KASPA is still below the bullish side of its consolidation range, indicating that it may take some time before it reaches the resistance level of the Darvas Box.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeKASPA\u2019s immediate and strongest support is pegged at the $0.10 price level, which was revisited several times during the sell-off last March. This level is historically significant, as it was the launch point before KASPA reached its all-time high of $0.1896. Currently, KASPA is poised to challenge the middle line of the Darvas Box, indicating a potential shift in trend if this attempt is successful. Additionally, the price is now staying above all moving averages, having recently broken out above the 100-day moving average.Inflection Points to watch out forSupports:$0.12 is the immediate support level, with $0.10 following closely behind.Resistance:The nearest resistance is pegged at $0.1424.Bullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period, is set at $0.1577.Bearish Targets:A break below $0.10 could potentially lead the price down to $0.040."}]}

Despite not grabbing much attention, various indicators hint at 1INCH being a potential sleeper play with promising upward momentum in the foreseeable future. It has recently solidified a robust support level at approximately $0.33, a price level repeatedly tested over the past few months. Keep an eye on the resistance level at around $7.00; a breakthrough here could trigger a notable rally.Reasons behind the sluggish priceGeneral Market Conditions:The overall cryptocurrency market sentiment is cautiously optimistic. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are still under a consolidation period on the long term perspective, altcoins like 1INCH could see increased attention as traders look for opportunities with higher potential returns.Market Structure and Timing:When 1INCH couldn't maintain its position above the Darvas Box, it underwent a significant downturn, experiencing a 50% decline. Its endeavor to surpass the $0.70 mark happened during the post-BTC ETF approval phase, marked by heightened market optimism. However, both 1INCH and the broader market witnessed necessary pullbacks, dampening the follow-through of its breakout attempt. The subsequent pullback was exacerbated by concerns over Iran/Israel tensions, leading to a widespread sell-off across the cryptocurrency market.100-Day Moving Average:While 1INCH made a breakout attempt in recent weeks, it couldn't maintain its position above the 100-day moving average on the weekly timeframe. This development might prompt traders and investors to temporarily hold off on their investments, as it may take some time before 1INCH attempts to breach this significant moving average.Technical analysis on a Weekly timeframeThe recent positioning of 1INCH below the middle line of the Darvas Box suggests a potential for a longer holding period, as the momentum appears to be sluggish at the moment. This could imply a period of consolidation or a slower rate of price movement until there is a significant shift in market sentiment or fundamental factors.If 1INCH manages to breach the middle line of the Relative Strength Index (RSI), it could indicate a potential shift in momentum. This would align with the scenario of the price breaking above all the moving averages on the weekly timeframe, which could attract market participants to enter the market before the next upward movement.A significant milestone to watch for is the potential break above the 100-day moving average on the weekly timeframe, currently approaching the $0.46 mark. This level aligns with the middle line of the Darvas Box, adding to its significance. A successful breach of this level could trigger a spike in price and mark the beginning of a new market structure for 1INCH.Technical analysis on a 1-day timeframeOn the daily timeframe, there are indications of a possible reversal as the price surpasses the 20-day moving average for the first time since the sell-off in March, followed by a breakout above the bullish side of the Darvas Box. 1INCH has been consolidating within a tight range for approximately 40 days, fluctuating between $0.47 and $0.32. A minor pullback to retest the $0.40 price level could occur before the next swing setup.Inflection Points to watch out forSupports:The immediate support for the price is at $0.41, with subsequent support at $0.32.Resistance:Surpassing the $0.475 mark could drive the price up to $0.56.Bullish Targets:As the price is likely to challenging the resistance pegged at $0.475, its next target would be around $0.56Bearish Targets:If the price fails to break above $0.32, expect the price to dive to as low as $0.22."}]}

Its deflationary model and GhostDAG protocol ensure efficient transactions. Meanwhile, the recent surge in Ethereum's price, attributed to heightened prospects of a US Ethereum ETF approval, underscores broader market optimism.

This anticipated milestone not only reflects growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies but also positions Layer 1s for potential growth amid increasing investor confidence.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsThe price of KAS has risen 360% since the October 2023 bull run began. After this rise, it has had a pullback of approximately 48% towards the lower margin of the $0.1 reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) traced from the January 2024 low to its ATH.But after staying in a sideways range for a little over a month, the price started to gain momentum again, definitely rejecting the above mentioned reversal zone at $0.12 and breaking the 0.23 and 0.38 Fibonacci levels traced from its ATH to its last low.For the KAS price to continue to rise, it should not return to the $0.12 area, and ideally it should not break the 0.38 Fibonacci level from its ATH at $0.135 to the downside again, but should remain a support for the price.Short-Term Price TargetsThe ideal entry for KAS was at $0.123, after it rejected the upside reversal zone at $0.12 and breached the 0.23 Fibonacci level at $0.1215.In case the price made a pullback to the $0.13 or $0.125 area, an entry could be attempted from that area.Should the price retest the $0.12 level and respect it to the upside, the initial entry at $0.123 could be taken.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

It is worth noting that this price zone corresponds to the 0.38 Fibonacci level from its last low.If price action rejects this area to the upside it can definitely lead RNDR price to surpass the reversal zone from its ATH located between $10.82 and $12.05, leaving the stage set for the price to reach and break the current ATH.Short-Term Price TargetsThe ideal entry zone for a long in RNDR would have been after breaking the 0.23 Fibonacci level from its ATH at $8.2, but since that zone was breached in early May, a re-entry that has a good probability of success should be sought.The first area to monitor for a bounce to the upside would be the $10 price zone, which has already been mentioned as a strong support for the RNDR price. If this price zone is rejected again to the upside, you can look for an entry between $10 and $10.5.The second price zone would be in case the price turns back towards the reversal zone from the last low, between $8.8 and $8 approximately, where the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the ATH is also located.

This pullback is expected to be relatively narrow, given the recent price action showing less volatility. It is likely to consolidate within a single candle range between $71,556 and $66,058. Immediate support is projected near the moving averages, as the price is nearing all of them, which also coincides with the middle line of the Darvas Box.Technical Analysis InsightsLiquidity and volatility surged over the past few days as Bitcoin made an 8% move, breaching the bullish side of the Darvas Box. However, a period of muted movement may be expected for BTC as Bitcoin Dominance (BTCDom) continues its downward trend, even falling below its recent consolidation range. On the daily timeframe, BTCDom remains above the 100-day moving average, suggesting support and a potential for staying above significant levels.If history repeats itself, another upward movement can be anticipated. Throughout the four previous Bitcoin halvings, a recurring pattern has emerged where Bitcoin tends to undergo a pullback before initiating a new surge. For example, in July 2016, Bitcoin experienced a notable retracement of approximately 30%, which was followed by a remarkable surge of 3000%.Potential Weekend Outcomes1.)

Bitcoin could challenge the Darvas Box resistance and potentially reach a new all-time high if the general market sentiment shifts to an overly bullish stance.SnapshotConstantly trailing the nearest moving average (MA20) on the weekly timeframe, BTCDom could potentially be contributing to the dry and sluggish movement of Bitcoin.BTC.D recently created a fake-out move before it corrected and pulled back close to the 100-day moving average.Bitcoin's momentum may remain sluggish over the weekend as BTC dominance declines, and the news about Ethereum\u2019s ETF approval could influence capital rotation.Weekend and Monday OutlookIt sounds like the market might be in for a quiet weekend, with low volatility and liquidity. Since both BTC and BTC dominance are showing predictable movements, it seems unlikely that there will be any major surprises. Without any significant news events on the horizon to shake things up, the overall sentiment is likely to stay subdued.Forecast FlashIt appears that BTCDom is testing a key support level around the $2,300 mark. If this level is breached, it could signal the beginning of the ALT COIN season, especially as Bitcoin approaches its own immediate support."}]}

Emphasising interoperability and advanced technologies like federated learning, Fetch.ai aims to transform various industries and foster a secure, autonomous economy.Ethereum ETF approval during the afternoon of May 23 could boost sentiment towards AI-focused cryptocurrencies such as FET, signalling regulatory acceptance and mainstream adoption.Additionally, the announcement of ASI's creation made this April, merging Fetch.ai, SingularityNet, and Ocean Protocol, aims to democratise AI development and enhance AI altcoin\u2019s market presence, potentially increasing investor interest and market capitalization.Featured Cryptocurrency of the Week: FETThis Week's Breakthroughs:On Monday, May 20, news broke that Ethereum ETFs could be approved, which sent FET sharply higher for the week.During the afternoon of Thursday, May 23, the ETFs finally received partial approval from the SEC, as Form 19b-4s were admitted, and not the S-1s that would signify final approval for the ETFs to begin transacting businessHowever, this represents a paradigm shift for the Ethereum ecosystem and all altcoins, as analysts say the SEC has stopped considering ETH as a security by allowing it to list its ETF through a Form S-1, which is considered commodity-specific.Needless to say, if ETF Form S-1s are finally approved, this would result in a huge influx of institutional capital entering the crypto market in the long term.Technical AnalysisRecent Price MovementsFET scored a 24% high following news of the possible approval of the Ethereum ETF.That rally lasted until Wednesday 22nd afternoon, when the price action had surpassed its strongest short-term resistance of $2.6.However, FET failed to hold and fell below resistance, closing its daily candle with a rejection of the zone, which increases its strength as a key level to be surpassed should the price look to go to new highs.Future PerspectivesSince the $2.6 price zone was finally rejected to the downside, the next important level for the price to hold is $2.256 (the 0.78 Fibonacci level from the last low and the end of the reversal zone). In case it is broken to the downside, the $2.04 level, where the 1.27 Fibonacci level from the last low and the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the ATH converge, which constitutes an important support and should be respected to the upside to try to go to new highs.As specified in this week's FET report, one should wait for the price to respect each zone at the daily candle close to attempt entries to the upside. These zones updated according to FET's downward price movements would be $2.28 and $2.04. Entries would therefore be after the price respects each zone to the upside at the daily candle close, at $2.4 and $2.1 respectively.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesRender (RNDR):RNDR has descended again towards the $10 zone and has again respected it, cementing our weekly hypothesis that it remains the main support at the moment. In the $9.8-$10 price zone is located the 0.38 Fibonacci level from its last low on May 1st.Ocean Protocol (OCEAN):OCEAN has again rejected the $1.1 price zone on the downside, which currently establishes it as strong resistance. If it is surpassed, the long entry in this zone would be triggered again."}]}

Despite experiencing less volatility following last Monday\u2019s 8% move, the breakout past the $67,000 resistance suggests that a dip shortly is unlikely. Bitcoin dominance is approaching its short-term range low, signalling a probable bounce soon. This anticipated bounce could disrupt the ongoing altcoin rally, challenging the expectations of a BTC price drop unless catastrophic events trigger fear among general market participants.Market Movement Analysis-Post BTC Halving Expectations:The recent event has yet to have a significant impact on the market, as it has experienced declines over the past few weeks. Historically, Bitcoin tends to trigger a parabolic rally post-halving, but the actual pricing-in of the halving event typically occurs a few months later. This delayed reaction is often due to the time it takes for the reduced supply to be felt in the market and for investor sentiment to adjust accordingly.-Market Cycle:The leading crypto-asset is currently in a re-accumulation phase, and the longer this period lasts, the stronger the subsequent uptrend is likely to be. Although BTC is experiencing a mini rally, moving from $56,000 to $71,981, the larger timeframe indicates that it remains within a ranging market.-Relative Strength Index: Bitcoin\u2019s RSI exhibits similarities between the 2016 and 2024 cycles. In 2016, the RSI surged from 60 to 90 thrice before peaking, while this cycle has seen only one surge so far. Despite Bitcoin failing to hold its price above $70,000, data suggests its bull rally is far from over.1-Week Technical AnalysisBitcoin has moved out of the \"danger zone\" where historical corrections have typically occurred during its market cycles. The recent breakout past the $67,000 resistance suggests that a dip soon is unlikely.It has also exited the bearish side of the Darvas Box, indicating a bullish consolidation phase when it broke above $65,000 two weeks ago. This move coincided with BTC rising above all the moving averages for the first time since April.The volumes during the declines over the past week were below average, which could indicate that short-term holders are taking profits.1-Day Technical AnalysisLast week, Bitcoin's price gradually declined after attempting to reach all-time high levels near $72,000. The only significant move was an 8% surge last Monday, resulting in a bullish engulfing candle. Following this, the anticipated pullback occurred, though it was quite narrow, merely retesting the previous breakout zone. Both BTC and BTC dominance are exhibiting predictable movements, suggesting that major surprises are unlikely. With no significant news events on the horizon to disrupt the market, the overall sentiment is likely to remain subdued.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$64,600 as immediate support, followed by $60,803.-Resistance:BTC needs to break above $73,800 to confirm its next leg up and to stay above the bullish side of the box.Bullish Targets:Should the price exceed $73,800, it could pave the way for a rally up to $85,176.. This projection aligns with the Fibonacci extension at the 1.618 level, indicating a strong potential for upward momentum.Bearish Targets:In the event of a significant negative catalyst, driving BTC's price below $60,000, we could witness market-wide turmoil. Such a scenario might prompt Bitcoin to retrace and test the $50,000 support level once again."}]}

Although Monday\u2019s volatility was extreme with an 18% move as rumours about the approval circulated, the price may have already factored in the news. On the day of the actual approval, the price remained relatively stable, showing no significant movement either during or after the announcement.Reasons for Upward Surge-ETH ETF Approval:The Ethereum price broke out above the middle line of the Darvas Box, a move supported by widespread rumours about the approval of an Ethereum ETF, which caused the price to rise 9% in about 20 minutes on Monday.-Trendline Breakout:Ethereum has been experiencing a downtrend since March, but a course change occurred when it broke a short-term trendline, coinciding with a breakout above all the moving averages. One possible explanation for this turnaround could also be attributed to the approval of an Ethereum ETF.1-Week Technical AnalysisEthereum is approaching the $4,000 price level following the approval of an ETF last Thursday. Despite the announcement, there has been a narrow consolidation between $3,700 and $3,900, indicating a cautious market sentiment even during the date of the announcement.In addition,it emerged as the primary driver of bullish sentiment last week, contributing to a surge in the overall market, including the altcoin markets. Altcoins have demonstrated strong performance over the past month, with Memecoins particularly standing out as the top performers.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching the 70 level, suggesting a potential parabolic move, particularly coinciding with a break above the $4,000 level. This development is likely to occur soon, as the general market explores additional investment options while Bitcoin continues to consolidate.1-Day Technical AnalysisAs Ethereum maintains its consolidation phase, the price is approaching the critical $4,000 mark. While breaking above $4,100 would be ideal, surpassing the whole number threshold could potentially signal another higher-high structure. Despite the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily timeframe exceeding the 70 mark, indicating an overbought condition, no reversal signals have emerged yet as the price steadily approaches recent highs. This suggests that overbought levels may continue to rise, possibly reaching RSI 90, which is often considered the start of a parabolic run once it surpasses key levels like $4,000.Key Inflection Points-Supports:The immediate support level stands at $3,341, with secondary support at $2,800.-Resistance:If the price breaks above $4,100, it could consolidate around the $4,625 level.Bullish Targets:The price may challenge the nearest resistance pegged at $4,100. If this happens, the next potential target is set at $4,863, the all-time high price of Ethereum.Bearish Targets:Falling below the $2,808 mark could likely push the price down to around $2,200."}]}

This protocol enables seamless data exchange among diverse blockchain platforms, solidifying Cosmos as a frontrunner in the blockchain industry. Strategic partnerships and ongoing advancements continue to boost investor confidence and pave the way for a more interconnected blockchain future.The Cosmos network offers cost-effective scaling with near-zero fees and transaction rates as low as 500ms, leveraging IBC connections from hundreds of validators to ensure enterprise-grade security. Despite a decrease in active wallets and transactions, Cosmos remains stable with an APR of 14% and a market cap of $3.2 billion. Recent developments, such as the launch of Hydro, an interchain auction for liquidity exports, and a connected economy valued at over $117 billion, highlight its robust ecosystem.Market Movements ExploredAfter falling approximately 50% from its 2024 high, ATOM continues within a sideways phase defined by the extremes of the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) drawn from its October 2023 Low to its 2024 High, between $9.4 and $8.0.In addition, it is using the 0.13 Fibonacci level from its 2024 High as support, which continues to make it more likely that this level will be established as a support from which the price could have considerable upward momentum.To increase the chances of a new bullish rally, ATOM's price action must break above the $9.4 level on the daily candlestick close, i.e. break above the reversal zone where it is sideways, and the 0.23 Fibonacci level from its 2024 high.Finally, given that the price of ATOM has been in a sideways or accumulation phase for 45 days, and that it is also forming a triangle, we could see a strong price development in the coming weeks if the market is volatile.Short-Term Price TargetsTo try to take advantage of a new bullish run, two entries could be programmed:-The first one at $8.5 and with a lower confirmation level, as ATOM price has bounced back to the lower boundary of the above reversal zone and the 0.13 Fibonacci level.-The second entry would be at $9.5,with a higher confirmation level, once the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the same high is surpassed and the reversal zone from the October 2023 low is rejected to the upside.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

Historically, such partnerships have served dual purposes: marketing and fan engagement. Notable examples include sponsorships by cryptocurrency exchanges like FTX and Binance in major sports events and teams, and the introduction of fan tokens by platforms such as Chiliz.Layer 0 protocols, which provide the underlying infrastructure for other blockchains, have also begun to explore these opportunities. Polkadot (DOT), Cosmos (ATOM), and Quant (QNT) have not been as active in sports partnerships compared to more prominent Layer 1 blockchains. However, their involvement in such collaborations could significantly impact their visibility and user engagement. Polkadot's recent move to sponsor Conor Daly marks a notable step for an L0 protocol in leveraging sports sponsorships for broader recognition and engagement.Polkadot\u2019s Community-Driven SponsorshipThe sponsorship of race car driver Conor Daly by the Polkadot community is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it represents the first major athlete sponsorship decided by community vote using blockchain technology, showcasing a practical application of decentralized governance. This approach differentiates the protocol from traditional corporate sponsorships, emphasizing the power and potential of decentralized decision-making.This development ties into the historical context by extending the use of blockchain technology beyond financial transactions and fan tokens, demonstrating its capability in orchestrating large-scale, community-driven initiatives. Polkadot\u2019s community voting mechanism, OpenGov #514, receiving 95.8% approval, illustrates the growing trust and participation in decentralized systems, aligning with the broader trend of increasing blockchain adoption in various sectors.Sponsorship Influences DOT\u2019s GrowthIncreased visibility from Daly's participation in high-profile racing events like the Indianapolis 500 can attract new users and investors to the Polkadot ecosystem. This heightened interest could lead to an increase in TVL as more projects and users migrate to the platform, attracted by its decentralized governance and active community.However, there are potential downsides. The effectiveness of this sponsorship in driving long-term engagement and investment remains uncertain. If the initiative fails to convert fan engagement into actual adoption of Polkadot's technology, the impact on TVL and market cap may be minimal. Additionally, the allocation of 290,000 DOT to fund the sponsorship could be seen as a risk if it doesn't yield the expected returns, potentially leading to criticism from stakeholders.Distinctive Marketing StrategyThis sponsorship positions DOT distinctively against competitors like Cosmos (ATOM) and Quant (QNT). While ATOM and QNT have focused more on technical advancements and interoperability solutions, Polkadot\u2019s move into sports sponsorships represents a strategic diversification. This approach could enhance its brand visibility and user engagement more effectively than purely technical marketing strategies.As of now, neither Cosmos nor Quant has engaged in high-profile sports partnerships. This lack of similar initiatives from ATOM and QNT means Polkadot's unique strategy could give it a competitive edge in terms of mainstream recognition and adoption. However, this differentiation also comes with risks. If its foray into sports sponsorship does not translate into tangible growth, it could be perceived as a misallocation of resources compared to its competitors who are focusing on enhancing their core technological capabilities."}]}

This proposes significant upgrades to the protocol, including a Unified Liquidity Layer, to integrate features like automatic interest rate adjustments and Liquidity Premiums, anticipating a streamlined borrowing and lending experience.Market Movements ExploredAAVE scored a sharp rise of approximately 17% following news that Ethereum ETFs could be approved on Monday, May 20, and finally jumped approximately 21.6% as of Thursday, May 23, when ETH ETF Forms 19b-4s were finally approved, totaling an increase of nearly 34% from Monday to the next highest point reached during Sunday, May 26.This strong Fundamental has caused AAVE to finally reject to the upside the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) drawn from its 2023 low, and the major support that had been established at the $81 area where the 0.13 Fibonacci level from its 2024 high also resides.Since the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high has been breached, it is important that the AAVE price respects this level to continue higher, as well as the reversal zone starting at $88.Short-Term Price TargetsGiven that the ideal entry levels given in the last AAVE report on May 15 have been exceeded, to attempt a long with a good chance of success new entry points should be sought during a pullback to key supports which could be the beginning of the reversal zone from the low at $81 which coincides with the 0.13 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high. This entry would be once the price rejects the $93.5 zone, i.e. at $95.Similarly, an entry at $103 could be attempted, but only after the price rejects the upside price zone between $100 and $102, where the beginning of the reversal zone drawn from the low of Thursday, May 23 is located.The last thing to keep in mind is that since AAVE has already had a significant rise during the last week, there could be corrections towards the $88 - $81 price zones again.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

The immediate support is evident, with the 20-day moving average acting as a trailing guide, as the price has moved sideways for the past 45 days. Despite the recent pullback and the current consolidation phase, Cardano remains supported on the larger timeframe, particularly on the weekly chart. Here, it is underpinned by the strongest moving average (MA100) and the multi-year high flip zone, suggesting a robust foundation despite short-term volatility.Reasons for Slow Price- Market Cycle:Cardano found support near the $0.40 mark and has been consolidating within a 30% range, suggesting an accumulation stage within the Darvas Box. This prolonged consolidation phase indicates that the price is building a base, potentially setting the stage for a future breakout.- Performance:ADA has indeed experienced a significant decline of over 50% since the sell-off in March. The subsequent month saw a further decline of 30% amid the Iran/Israel tensions. Typically, after such a decline, the price would consolidate and may potentially enter a re-accumulation stage before establishing a new structure.- Moving Averages:As all the moving averages remain in inverted positions (with MA20 below MA50 and MA50 below MA100), the recent attempt by the price to recover and close the gap with the nearest moving average of 20 could signal the start of a reversal. However, staying above the 20-day moving average may prove challenging, given its resistance since the sell-off in March 2024. If ADA can sustain above the MA20, it might indicate growing bullish momentum and the potential end of the re-accumulation phase.1-Week Technical AnalysisAfter a six-week decline, Cardano's structure offers a clearer perspective on the weekly timeframe as it remains above the previous multi-year high breakout zone. This zone serves as a flip zone, where resistance turns into support, presenting a classic and straightforward setup that signals to long-term and mid-term investors to consider entering the market. This flip zone not only reinforces ADA's support but also suggests potential for future growth as the market stabilizes.A potential 600% reward awaits if the price manages to challenge the previous all-time high at $3.00. Position traders can consider purchasing core shares at a discounted price now, taking advantage of the market's current quietness.For midterm holders, the nearest resistance is at the $0.72 mark, offering a potential reward of 150%. This area serves as the optimal take-profit target for the recent swing high setup, providing a clear objective for those looking to capitalize on the current consolidation phase. Reaching this resistance level would mark a significant recovery from the recent lows and could attract more buying interest as the price approaches this key target.1-Day Technical AnalysisDuring the 6-week consolidation observed in the daily timeframe, Cardano has made two attempts to breach the $0.51 price level. Currently, it resides within the bearish territory of the Darvas Box again after a failed attempt last week, indicating that it may take a few days before attempting another breakout or even potentially touching the low end of the range. A stronger support zone is identified between the $0.35 and $0.40 marks, as these levels hold historical significance. They represent the previous breakout zone and witnessed a short-term consolidation in November 2023.Key Points to Watch- Supports:$0.40 as immediate support, followed by $0.35- Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $0.51.Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $0.51, the $0.68 price could be the next target.Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $0.35."}]}

The post-BTC ETF approval contributed to a 200% upward movement in just 5 weeks. However, as the pullback occurred last March, OCEAN experienced a 60% decline, including a dramatic 40% drop in just 2 days during the Iran/Israel tension. At the moment, OCEAN has potentially established its base, consolidating near the $0.90 mark over the past two months. This period of consolidation suggests that the market is stabilizing, possibly preparing for the next significant move.Sluggish Price Causes?- BTC\u2019s correction:During periods of daily declines in Bitcoin ranging from 1% to 5%, the ALT coin markets often face considerable downturns, typically seeing prices fall by approximately 20%. Consequently, leading up to the Bitcoin Halving, OCEAN experienced a significant drop of around 60% over the past 10 weeks. This illustrates the substantial impact that Bitcoin's price movements can have on the broader cryptocurrency market, including ALT coins like OCEAN.- Relative Strength Index (RSI):Despite its RSI never going below the middle line, it remains very steady on the 50-60 level which indicates a healthy pullback but may take a longer consolidation route.- Market Cycle:When a breakout attempt loses momentum, it often results in a return to a ranging pattern, potentially revisiting lower price levels. This is a frequent phenomenon in trading, where unsuccessful breakouts can lead to a retreat to previous price ranges, particularly amidst uncertain market sentiment or external factors affecting investor confidence. In the case of OCEAN, multiple attempts were made to break out above the $1 mark, but none managed to sustain the price movement.1-Week Technical AnalysisOn the weekly timeframe, OCEAN appears to be potentially forming a classic pattern known as the handle pattern. This pattern has emerged over nearly 2 months, with the price consolidating near the $0.90 level. The larger arc pattern may represent the cup, while the recent pullback could form the handle of the cup and handle pattern. The handle's support is reinforced by two key factors. Firstly, the 20-day moving average has been serving as a support, with the price tracking along it for over 8 weeks. Additionally, the price is approaching the previous breakout zone, which previously acted as a multi-year high price resistance but may now serve as support upon retesting. As the general market recovers, there is potential for the classic cup and handle pattern to materialize, potentially leading to a new all-time high price.1-Day Technical AnalysisOCEAN's daily price action has been consolidating within a narrow range of $1.089 to $0.767 over the past 45 days, marking a 30% range. Despite this sideways movement, an interesting pattern emerges in OCEAN's recent price structure: a stair-case-like formation characterized by a series of higher lows. Notably, the price has consistently avoided touching the lower boundary of the range. This pattern suggests the potential for a price spike in the near future, particularly if there's a shift in general market sentiment. It's worth mentioning that AI coins, including OCEAN, were among the market leaders during the October 2023 rally. Should another rally occur soon, OCEAN is likely to emerge as a leading contender once again.Key Points to Watch- Supports:$0.9127 as immediate support, followed by $0.6273- Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $1.08.Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $1.08, the $1.207 price could be the next target.Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $0.62."}]}

Its recent upward momentum gained around 90% within three weeks, moving from $100 to $205. Currently, SOL has entered the bullish side of the consolidation levels, trading above the middle line of the Darvas Box and the Fibonacci 50% retracement level, aiming to challenge the immediate resistance. The $136 level holds historical significance as it represents the flip zone of the previous breakout level and coincides with the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe.Solid Price Drivers- General Market Interest:Amidst subdued general market capitalisation and waning enthusiasm for BTC, SOL has also seen a decline in retail interest. Additionally, the trading volume over the past six weeks has been dwindling. While this might initially raise concerns, it is a positive development. A decrease in volume implies fewer sellers, suggesting a weakening bearish momentum. This scenario could create an opportunity for bulls to regain control of the market soon.- Delay in ETH ETF Approval:Although the ETH ETF was approved last week by the SEC, SOLANA\u2019s recent decline, with only a 15% drop, is merely considered a pullback. During the period of uncertainty when the ETH ETF approval was delayed, some market participants exercised caution and were reluctant to invest in ETH. This uncertainty surrounding the approval led certain investors to adopt a wait-and-see strategy, influencing market sentiment and investment patterns related to Ethereum. As a result, some investors favoured the Solana ecosystem over Ethereum while awaiting clarity on regulatory developments.- Market Cycle:Following its robust multi-year breakout at $1.36, SOL surged by approximately 50% before retracing back to this price level. This pullback was necessary to consolidate gains and establish a solid foundation for its next upward movement, as evidenced by the chart below.Weekly Technical AnalysisOver the past five weeks, Solana has exhibited relative stagnation despite navigating a ranging market, with volume consistently remaining below average. However, the foundation it is currently establishing could attract retail investors, as the structure suggests a potential swing high setup while resting on the previous breakout zone at $136. This level is further reinforced by the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe. Additionally, a classic cup and handle pattern has been identified, with a recent breakout from the support consolidation confirming the market structure break. This setup has already started to materialize, and the price might soon challenge the $200 mark.Daily Technical AnalysisWhile SOLANA is experiencing a decent pullback, it is now preparing for its next short-term swing high. This is strongly supported by its recent break above the $155 price level, which took SOL three attempts to successfully surpass. SOL had been in a 32-day consolidation before it finally broke out and continued its momentum by breaching the $160 mark, where the middle line of the Darvas Box is plotted. The current pullback is considered a retest of the breakout zones, positioning SOL to make new higher-high structures anytime soon.Key Inflection Points- Supports:$160 as immediate support, followed by $126.74- Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $202.38.Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $202.38, the $249.80 price could be the next target.Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $126."}]}

Initially, crypto gaming emerged with simple blockchain-based games, leveraging tokens for in-game assets and economies. These early attempts were rudimentary but laid the groundwork for more sophisticated applications. The rise of Ethereum introduced the concept of NFTs, enabling unique digital ownership and sparking a wave of collectible and play-to-earn games. As the DeFi space expanded, the idea of integrating financial elements within games gained traction. By 2021, platforms like Axie Infinity demonstrated the potential of blockchain gaming, showing substantial user engagement and revenue generation. However, high transaction fees and scalability issues on Ethereum highlighted the need for Layer 2 solutions to handle the growing demand efficiently.Arbitrum Targets Gaming GrowthThe approval of the Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) by Arbitrum's DAO is a significant development in the context of crypto gaming's evolution. This initiative signals a strategic shift by Arbitrum, a protocol primarily known for its DeFi success, into the expanding gaming sector. Historically, Layer 2 solutions have been critical in addressing Ethereum's scalability issues, enabling more complex and transaction-heavy applications like gaming. The GCP aims to leverage Arbitrum's technological advantages to attract top-tier game developers and establish a robust gaming ecosystem.GCP's Financial ImplicationsThe GCP's implementation is likely to have a substantial impact on Arbitrum's TVL and market capitalization. By committing 200 million ARB over three years, Arbitrum aims to foster a vibrant gaming ecosystem, which could drive significant user and developer activity on the platform. Increased gaming projects can lead to higher transaction volumes, thereby boosting TVL. Additionally, successful games can attract new users and investors, positively influencing ARB's market cap. However, there are potential downsides. The success of the GCP depends on attracting high-quality projects and retaining developer interest. If the initiative fails to deliver compelling games or faces governance issues, it could negatively impact investor confidence and Arbitrum's market position.Gaming Partnerships ComparisonArbitrum's Gaming Catalyst Program sets it apart from competitors like Polygon (MATIC) and Optimism (OP), which also have initiatives in the gaming space but on different scales. Polygon has made significant inroads with partnerships in the gaming industry, such as collaborations with Decentraland and The Sandbox. Optimism, while focused more on DeFi, has yet to announce a gaming initiative of comparable scale. Arbitrum's comprehensive approach, including substantial financial commitment, specialized teams, and infrastructure development, positions it as a formidable player in the crypto gaming arena. However, the competitive landscape is dynamic, and Arbitrum must deliver on its promises to maintain its edge. The potential for saturation in the gaming market and the need for continuous innovation and support could pose challenges."}]}

A necessary pullback occurred in the last week of December 2023, but the price quickly recovered, reaching a new high in the first quarter of this year. However, a sharp decline followed as the general market experienced a downturn in March 2024, exacerbated by the Iran/Israel tensions. AVAX suffered a rough 50% decline during this sell-off and has since been establishing a base, consolidating for over a month within the range of $29.38 to $39.37.Price Drop Reasons-BTC\u2019s correction:When BTC experiences daily declines ranging from 1% to 5%, the ALT coin markets often witness significant downturns, with prices falling by roughly 20%. Consequently, during BTC's recent pullback before the Halving, AVAX experienced a substantial 55% drop over the past few weeks, including a sharp\u00a0 40% sell-off over a consecutive three-day period due to the Iran/Israel tensions.-Market Cycle:After an impressive 600% surge since the October 2023 rally, a correction is deemed necessary before AVAX initiates its next upward movement. Currently, AVAX's breakout attempt was unsuccessful and may retest the Darvas Box middle line, along with the 20-day and 50-day moving averages.-Relative Strength Index:RSI of AVAX has remained stable since the sell-off, consistently hovering around the 50 mark. This stability suggests that the recent decline is merely a healthy pullback, necessary before its next rally.1-Week Technical AnalysisSince Avalanche broke out above the multi-year high resistance level at $30, it experienced a follow-through and a subsequent retest during the post-BTC ETF approval period. Despite a sharp decline influenced by general market fear, AVAX is now in a favourable resting zone, sitting on the multi-year high flip zone where resistance has turned into support. This type of price action sets the stage for a potential swing-high setup, particularly as the price consolidates, attracting more investors for its next upward movement. While it may take some time before the next move, a potential 250% reward awaits patient investors.1-Day Technical AnalysisAvalanche has been consolidating within a 30% range over the past 37 days. There were three unsuccessful attempts to establish a new structure, coinciding with a general market downturn and a lack of follow-through, particularly evident in Bitcoin's recent sideways movement. However, the current pullback may be a necessary retracement, testing the middle line of the Darvas Box and coinciding with two moving averages. The recent breakout attempt could indicate the formation of a higher-high, with this week\u2019s pullback potentially establishing a higher-low. If this structure materializes, AVAX is poised to challenge the recent highs near the $60 mark.Key Points to Watch-Supports:$34.47 as immediate support, followed by $30-Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $39.37.Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $39.37, the $49.96 price could be the next target.Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $20.86."}]}

RNDR has surged approximately 650% since the onset of the October 2023 rally, marking a remarkable 250% parabolic move within six weeks following the post-BTC ETF approval. This surge coincided with Render reaching a new all-time high price of $13.53. However, RNDR has recently undergone a healthy pullback, retesting its previous all-time high price level of $7.94.Steady Price Movement-Market Structure and Timing:When RNDR surged above the $8.00 price resistance and established a new all-time high, it marked an approximately 90% increase from its previous peak. Consequently, during market sell-offs and pullbacks, RNDR's decline is viewed as a healthy retest. This is attributed to RNDR's significant rise following the breakthrough of a multi-year high resistance level. Even a decline of 50% to 70% is anticipated to find support around the $8.00 mark, representing the price of the previous all-time high.-Market Cycle:Following an estimated 600% surge since the October 2023 rally, RNDR is due for a correction or at least a pullback. This surge, coupled with a parabolic move last February, indicates the need for a period of consolidation or retracement to establish a more sustainable price level.-Relative Strength Index:The relative strength index (RSI) of RNDR has remained stable since the sell-off, consistently hovering above the middle line and not dipping below the 50 mark. This stability indicates that the sell-off is likely a healthy pullback, serving as a necessary precursor to its next potential rally.1-Week Technical AnalysisThe weekly timeframe reveals a strong relationship between the price of RNDR and its 20-day moving average, which has been consistently respected since last year's rally. This indicator is a valuable guide for investors and traders in timing their entry and exit points. The relative strength index (RSI) has also consistently remained above the 60 mark, suggesting ongoing bullish momentum. A recent breach of the bullish side of the Darvas Box aligns with a bounce in the RSI when it dipped to around the 56 mark. These price actions collectively indicate the potential for RNDR to reach another all-time high soon.1-Day Technical AnalysisRender's price action is currently undergoing micromanagement, consolidating within a tight range of $9.88 to $11.57, marking a 15% range over the last three weeks. Despite this relatively short consolidation period, it occurs above both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, aligning with consolidation above the middle line of the Darvas Box. With these potential support factors in play, RNDR is primed to test the $14 mark and establish a new all-time high price.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$9.27 as immediate support, followed by $7.33-Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $13.48.Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $13.48, the $18.2 price could be the next target pegged at the Fibonnaci 1.618 level.Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $6.30."}]}

This decline comes incontrast to the significant growth and positive outlook for AI stocks, such as Nvidia, which has seen its value skyrocket. The disparity can be attributed to several factors, including recent macroeconomic concerns.

This macroeconomic uncertainty likely contributed to the decline in AI crypto tokens.InRNDR\u2019s case, thedecline in its market cap and pricecan beattributed to significant sell-offs by major holders, which created an oversupply and triggered a cascade of selling among smaller investors, amplifying the downward pressure on the token.Despitepositive developments such as a66% growth in node operators following its migration to Solana and increased adoption within the Solana DePIN sector, these fundamental strengths were overshadowed by the immediate impact of large-scale liquidations.OCEAN and FET have seen similar declines. This can be primarily attributed to theuncertainty and logistical challenges posed by their upcoming merger with SingularityNET to form the ASI token.

By enabling the creation of multi-chain applications (Mapps) that span multiple blockchains, Overledger facilitates messaging and transaction management in a principled way, transcending the limitations of individual blockchains. This revolutionary approach extends to writing smart contracts on traditionally incompatible blockchains such as Bitcoin, aiming for a unified ecosystem.At the heart of the Quant network is a marketplace tailored to multi-chain perspectives, backed by its QNT token, which serves as a vital element for transactional processes and resource allocation. In addition, the network has a dynamic community-driven treasury, which functions as a Mapp within its ecosystem, fostering collaboration and innovation. With enterprise integration in mind, Quant's Overledger platform is ready to respond to the evolving needs of businesses, positioning itself as a key player on the path to universal blockchain adoption.Market Movements ExploredThe price of QNT has had a maximum rise of approximately 82% from its October 2023 low, until meeting resistance at $149 at the 0.38 Fibonacci level traced from its ATH.From that level it has made a pullback to the $100 area, to rally back up to the same point ($149), making a Quadruple Top formation and then falling below the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the ATH to the reversal zone from the ATL, located between $81 and $113.In order for the price not to fall further, it must hold the $81 level which is the lower boundary of the ATL reversal zone. If broken, the price could head towards the $50 or even $40 level.Short-Term Price TargetsGiven that QNT is currently showing weakness and in a downtrend (in orange), it will need to show clear signs of recovery to increase the likelihood of a successful long trade.Two entries could be sought, the first more risky at $96, once the last relative highs have been broken to the upside, and the second at $100, where the 0.23 Fibonacci level would have been breached and the downtrend shown on the chart would have been broken.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

Despite this short-term steady price action, BTC has exited the risky zone by breaching the bullish side of the Darvas Box, buoyed by positive market sentiment following Ethereum's ETF approval. Meanwhile, BTC Dominance is attempting to recover as it hovers near the 100-day moving average, potentially retesting the previous breakout zone at $2,300.Technical Analysis InsightsWith BTC Dominance struggling to stay above the 100-day moving average, the current price level holds significant historical value, as the $2,300 mark is the previous multi-year high resistance which could potentially turn into support. If this scenario materializes, BTC could start to hit new all-time high prices soon.Bitcoin is recently trading close to the 20-day moving average after its significant move following the circulation of rumors about the Ethereum ETF approval on May 20th. Since then, BTC has been in a very narrow consolidation phase.It's been six weeks since the completion of the Halving, and Bitcoin's price has yet to make a significant move. However, with BTC Dominance undergoing a pullback and potentially stabilizing above the 100-day moving average or near the $2,300 mark, this could indicate the start of BTC\u2019s next leg up.Potential Weekend Outcomes1. For BTC to revisit levels below $65,000, significant external factors or events causing market fear and uncertainty would typically be required. Catastrophic news, such as regulatory crackdowns, security breaches, or macroeconomic instability, could trigger such a scenario. In the absence of such events, BTC is expected to maintain its current trajectory based on existing market dynamics, investor sentiment, and the fundamental factors influencing the cryptocurrency market.2. The critical level for Bitcoin is the MA100, which is now nearing the $65,000 mark and is about to cross the middle line of the Darvas Box. This could act as a trigger for short-term holders, suggesting that the price could spike anytime soon.3. BTC is anticipated to consolidate within the range of $71,556 - $66,058, potentially confirming a period of weekend consolidation before forming a new market structure for the upcoming week. Consolidation periods often occur after significant price movements and serve to establish support and resistance levels before the next directional move.SnapshotBTCDom consistently remains above the prior breakout zone at $2,300.As BTCDom finds stability as it hovers close to the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe, Bitcoin might gradually ascend while it continues to challenge the whole number resistance at $70,000.Bitcoin's momentum may not be fully apparent yet, but BTCDom's RSI (Relative Strength Index) remains near the 50 level, indicating a healthy consolidation for Bitcoin dominance in the cryptocurrency market. An RSI around 50 suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, pointing to a balanced period with potential for further upward movement. Therefore, while Bitcoin's momentum may not be fully realized, BTCDom's RSI suggests a positive outlook for Bitcoin's market dominance.Weekend and Monday OutlookA 4% or higher move in BTC is indeed considered highly volatile. Today's price action might not fully capture Bitcoin's volatility over the weekend, as BTC has been stalling near the low end of its range. Additionally, today marks the last trading day of the month. Many institutions, along with retail traders and investors, often secure profits at the end of the month, closing their books and looking for new potential movers as the new month begins. This could signal a take-profit day for some investors and traders.Forecast FlashBTC could potentially experience another 6% move over the next two days if BTCDom maintains its position above the $2,300 level."}]}

IBC allows seamless data exchange across diverse blockchain platforms, positioning Cosmos as a leader in blockchain interoperability.The Cosmos network offers cost-effective scaling with near-zero fees and fast transaction rates of 500ms, ensuring enterprise-grade security through IBC connections from numerous validators. Despite a decline in active wallets and transactions, Cosmos remains stable with a 14% APR and a $3.3 billion market cap. Recent developments, like the Hydro launch and a connected economy worth over $117 billion, underscore its robust ecosystem.Featured Cryptocurrency of the Week: ATOMThis Week's Breakthroughs:In a week of little movement for the crypto market, ATOM has remained sideways and respecting the triangle formation it has maintained since the strong correction that took place in mid-April.Mastercard has launched Crypto Credential, allowing crypto transfers using aliases instead of complex addresses. Now live on exchanges like Bit2Me and Lirium, this feature enhances security and usability by verifying identities and wallet compatibility. With plans to expand to over seven million users, Mastercard is setting a new standard in making cryptocurrencies more accessible and user-friendly.On Monday, May 20, the possibility of Ethereum ETFs being approved sent FET soaring. By Thursday, May 23, the SEC granted partial approval, accepting Form 19b-4s, marking a major shift in the Ethereum ecosystem, as the SEC's approval of commodity-specific Form S-1 would suggest ETH is no longer viewed as a security and its final approval could significantly boost institutional investment in ETH and the altcoins market.Technical AnalysisRecent Price Movements:ATOM has returned to the position where it started the week, rejecting the upper margin of the triangle it has been forming since mid-April. Currently, this triangle is in a key area, as the price is in an area close to where the ascending and descending guidelines cross.Given ATOM's current price position, multiple scenarios are possible: speculating that the triangle in formation is bullish, the Market Maker can generate a pullback in price towards a trap zone such as the 1.27 - 1.61 Fibonacci levels from the last relative high, located at $7.77 and $7.45 respectively.Another scenario where the price could turn around to the upside is the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from the last high, between $8.36 and $8.2.In both cases, the development could be as marked by the grey arrow, as the triangle would be a bullish formation.Future Perspectives:In any case, to look for a bullish development in the price and a long trade with a higher probability of success, we should wait for one of the key zones mentioned above to be rejected to the upside: the reversal zone between $8.36 and $8.2, or the 1.27 - 1.61 levels located at $7.77 and $7.45. Both are price areas where the downtrend of the last 3 days could be reversed triggering the above mentioned bullish triangle.Therefore, in order to increase the probability of success, the entry should be at $8.5, which would mean that: both zones were rejected to the upside, that the 0.13 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high was breached, and also that the top of the bullish triangle has been reached.An entry with a higher confirmation level would be at $9.1, where the last relative highs would have been breached as well as the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesQuant (QNT):QNT in the same movement as ATOM, has touched the upper edge of the descending channel it has been following, and has currently lost the $91 area which represents the 0.13 Fibonacci level since its last high, so until it recovers this area it is not advisable to attempt a long trade.Polkadot (DOT):DOT has rejected to the downside its current main support at the $7.8 price zone, and is currently inside the reversal zone traced from that zone. Should it lose the key $6.7 zone, price could head towards the $6.5 area. Ideally, it should respect the uptrend line it has been holding since mid-April for the upside probabilities to remain strong."}]}

The price may have already factored in this news, as the official announcement by the SEC did not trigger any substantial market movement. Overall, the market sentiment can be considered cautiously bullish at the moment. Despite today's 2% move in BTC, the volume remains notably low.Market Movement Analysis-Capital Rotation:Despite expectations of a rally following the approval of Spot Ether ETFs, both Ether and Bitcoin experienced a decline. The market appears to be in a \"MEME Coin Era\" as certain meme coins are seeing massive surges. A survey found a growing interest in meme coins compared to Bitcoin, with 53.7% of respondents indicating they would choose meme coins over Bitcoin.-BTC Low Funding Rate:Bitcoin's funding rate has remained low since mid-May, indicating subdued investor expectations, which is positive for BTC's price. The funding rate, which is the cost of holding an open contract, is currently at $0.01%. A positive rate suggests that the perpetual futures price is trading above the index value. The low funding rate and declining price imply that perpetual futures buyers are fading Bitcoin's move, while spot traders are becoming more aggressive. This dynamic suggests that Bitcoin is likely to retest the $70,000 mark soon, despite the low funding rate.-Low Volatility:Traders and short-term investors thrive on high volatility movements, as volatility creates opportunities for profitable setups. However, Bitcoin's recent low volatility suggests that its price might continue to fluctuate within a tight range for some time. This lack of significant movement could lead to capital rotation within the general market, prompting some investors to seek out the explosive price action of meme coins instead.1-Week Technical AnalysisBitcoin has been in a narrow consolidation phase for the past 14 days, recently touching the potential low of its range. The movement from the low to the top of this range is only about 5%, leading to reduced volume and volatility. This limited price action has contributed to a period of stagnation for Bitcoin.Bitcoin's weekly price action indicates a healthy consolidation, staying above the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box. Additionally, the 20-day moving average is gradually approaching the $65,000 mark, reinforcing the stability and potential upward momentum.Lastly, Bitcoin's relative strength index (RSI) is encountering resistance at the overbought level, with the 70 mark acting as a ceiling. This resistance is contributing to tighter daily volatility, with price movements of less than 3% per day. However, if Bitcoin breaks above the $70,000 mark, it could trigger another parabolic move.1-Day Technical AnalysisLast week, Bitcoin dipped below the $67,000 mark but quickly recovered as the 20-day moving average provided support. Despite this recovery, volume continues to decline even after the approval of Spot Ether ETFs. However, Bitcoin appears to be out of the danger zone, with all moving averages aligning. This alignment suggests a potential swing high setup may materialize once the general market commits to participating in Bitcoin\u2019s next leg up.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$65,100 as immediate support, followed by $60,803.-Resistance:BTC needs to break above $70,000 to confirm its next leg up and to stay above the bullish side of the box.Bullish Targets:Should the price exceed $73,800, it could pave the way for a rally up to $85,176. This projection aligns with the Fibonacci extension at the 1.618 level, indicating a strong potential for upward momentum.Bearish Targets:In the event of a significant negative catalyst, driving BTC's price below $60,000, we could witness market-wide turmoil. Such a scenario might prompt Bitcoin to retrace and test the $50,000 support level once again."}]}

This suggests that Bitcoin may potentially outperform Ethereum in the short term as the correlation between the two continues to decline.1-Week Technical AnalysisEthereum's immediate resistance is set at $3,880, a crucial level coinciding with the recent opening and closing prices of weekly candles. Despite a breakout attempt last week, Ethereum's price action lacked follow-through. This may be influenced by data from Glassnode indicating an increase in the circulating supply of both Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). This suggests that although exchange availability may have decreased, the overall market supply remains elevated.A classic Mark-of-Momentum setup has unfolded on the weekly timeframe, characterized by a bullish engulfing candle followed by a pause candle (such as a doji or hammer). The highs of these two candles serve as immediate resistance levels, aligning with the key resistance level around $3,880 or close to $3,900. A breakout above these levels could trigger a parabolic move, potentially propelling Ethereum's price towards the all-time high of $4,878.1-Day Technical AnalysisEthereum's price action indicates a period of tight consolidation, with volatility remaining below 5% over the past two weeks. The candle on May 23 delineates the boundaries of Ethereum's consolidation, showcasing sideways movement. Notably, Ethereum has consistently stayed above the bullish trajectory of this consolidation, with $3,700 acting as a reliable support level, leading to price rebounds upon revisiting. With Bitcoin nearing the $70,000 mark, it may temporarily outshine Ethereum. However, as capital rotation shifts from BTC to ETH, there's potential for Ethereum to undergo a parabolic move in the coming weeks.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$3,700. as immediate support, followed by $3,300-Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $3,880.Bullish Targets:At the moment, the nearest target for ETH is projected at $4,000.Bearish Targets:A break below $3,700 could potentially lead the price down to $3,400."}]}

Since the October 2023 rally, it has undergone a substantial increase, soaring approximately 300% from its recent low of $0.967. After the approval of the BTC-ETF, NEAR experienced another surge, climbing by 250% over six weeks and breaking free from its long-term consolidation. Despite encountering a 50% decline during a sell-off in March, NEAR found robust support around the multi-year high of $5.50, rebounding convincingly and indicating a healthy retracement. Despite Ethereum\u2019s ETF approval, NEAR has yet to make significant strides and remains relatively stable, hovering close to the $7.00 mark.Market Movement AnalysisGeneral Market Sentiment:Regardless of the positive growth observed in the NEAR Protocol, both Ethereum and Bitcoin have shown sluggish movement, contrary to expectations of a rally following the approval of Spot Ether ETFs. As leading cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Bitcoin typically set the tone for the broader market. However, Ethereum has remained stable and has not yet made a significant move that would propel the rest of its ecosystem forward.Market Stance:In Q1 2024, NEAR Protocol demonstrated a notable 140% increase, indicating a positive outlook despite a period of longer consolidation. This optimistic trajectory can be attributed to initiatives such as the NEAR AI Research & Development Lab. Additionally, the steady movement can be attributed to the activities of two prominent dApps, Kai-Ching and Sweat Economy, which have been driving traffic to the NEAR ecosystem.Even during a recent 50% decline over the past six weeks, NEAR managed to maintain its position above the $6.00 mark and even surpassed the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box, historically marking the previous multi-year high. This level has now transitioned into immediate support, showcasing a classic flip zone where resistance transforms into support.Capital Rotation:The recent market trend appears to be characterized by what some are calling the \"MEME Coin Era,\" with notable names such as Turbo, ELON, and STRUMP experiencing significant explosive growth. Despite the general market remaining relatively flat since May 23rd, these meme coins have seen substantial pumping activity. This phenomenon reflects a shift in investor sentiment towards speculative and meme-driven assets, highlighting the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets and the influence of social media and online communities on investment behavior.1-Week Technical AnalysisAfter a five-week decline, NEAR exhibited a significant reversal or swing high setup, rebounding strongly after touching the 20-day moving average. Additionally, the price currently resides above the middle line of the Darvas Box, suggesting a bullish consolidation on a larger time frame. This presents a substantial opportunity for position traders, with the next resistance level set at $16.79, offering a potential 140% reward once its next upward movement begins.At present, NEAR is in the process of challenging the previous high of the rally, aiming to surpass the $8.248 mark. A successful breakthrough at this level would establish a higher-high structure, thereby confirming the anticipation of an upcoming rally.In conclusion, NEAR's relative strength index (RSI) on the weekly timeframe maintains a bullish stance, consistently staying above the 50 mark and indicating ongoing strength in the market. Since the sell-off in March, the RSI has remained above the middle line, affirming a robust and healthy pullback in the price action.1-Day Technical AnalysisNEAR experienced a significant rejection from its recent high of $9.036, resulting in a notable 53% decline over 29 days. However, during this downturn, the price found support at its strongest moving average, maintaining its position above it even during the sell-off in April, which was driven by concerns surrounding tensions between Iran and Israel. Since then, the 100-day moving average has continued its upward trajectory and has recently breached the middle line range, with the price following closely before eventually surging upward. This development confirms that all the moving averages are now aligned in the correct order: the 20-day moving average is positioned above the 50-day moving average, and the 50-day moving average is above the 100-day moving average. Such a structural alignment indicates a normal and healthy uptrend across all timeframes.Key Inflection PointsSupports:The immediate support for the price is at $6.72, with subsequent support at $5.21.Resistance:Surpassing the $8.87 mark could drive the price up to $11.13.Bullish Targets:As the attempt to break out is getting closer, a farther target is set at $16.79.Bearish Targets:If the price fails to break out, the price could potentially visit the 20-day moving average of the weekly timeframe pegged at $5.96."}]}

Charles Hoskinson, Cardano's co-founder, is optimistic about these developments, highlighting the enhancements in scalability and transaction efficiency brought by the new consensus mechanism Ouroboros Leios.In addition, recent data indicates increased whale transactions, signalling heightened interest from influential investors. This uptick in large-scale activity suggests potential price reversals and positive market sentiment. With ADA price stabilizing, Cardano's robust ecosystem and innovative updates make it an asset that has significant potential in the blockchain ecosystem.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsADA has seen a rise of more than 230% from its October 2023 low to its 2024 high.This rise has been close to reaching the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from the April 2022 high.After this, the price of ADA has had a pullback of approximately 50% towards the reversal zone drawn from the October 2023 low between $0.36 and $0.46, which it is currently respecting. It is noteworthy that this zone also coincides with the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the April 2022 high.For there to be a bullish continuation or a clear exit from the sideways trend that ADA has been in for almost two months, the reversal zone between $0.36 and $0.46 must be respected to the upside, with the $0.36 zone also being key as it also coincides with the 0.13 Fibonacci level from the April 2022 high.Short-Term Price TargetsTo capture a possible upside move in ADA, two entries can be seen:- The first and riskier one would be at $0.47, once the reversal zone and the 0.13 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high are rejected.- The most confirmed and likely to succeed at $0.52, where the last relative highs would have been surpassed as well as the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

Starting with Bitcoin futures in December 2017, followed by Ethereum in 2021, CME has played a crucial role in legitimizing cryptocurrency as an asset class for institutional investors. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, is a high-performance blockchain known for its scalability and low transaction costs. Launched in 2020, Solana quickly ascended to become one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite its rapid growth and technological advancements, Solana has faced regulatory scrutiny similar to other major cryptocurrencies.Future Listing Hopes DashedThe recent announcement that CME Group is not planning to list Solana (SOL) futures soon is significant. It contradicts previous industry speculation and dampens hopes for SOL's inclusion in mainstream financial instruments like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This decision is rooted in ongoing legal and regulatory challenges faced by Solana and the broader cryptocurrency market. The mention by finance lawyer Scott Johnsson highlights the legal hurdles, especially given the lawsuits against major exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance. These challenges underscore the complexities that Solana faces in achieving broader acceptance and regulatory approval.Regulatory Challenges Stall GrowthThe absence of Solana futures on CME has immediate and long-term implications for SOL\u2019s market dynamics. Futures contracts are crucial for price discovery and providing hedging mechanisms for investors. Without this, institutional interest may remain subdued, limiting SOL's market cap growth potential. Furthermore, the reduced likelihood of SOL achieving ETF status in the near future restricts its accessibility to a broader investor base, potentially stalling its adoption and growth in TVL. The relatively stable price of SOL despite the news suggests that the market had not heavily priced in the expectation of futures listings, but this stability may not hold if regulatory challenges persist."}]}

This innovation has propelled Lido to become a pioneer in the liquid staking space, supporting multiple PoS blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana, ensuring transparency and decentralization through its native token, LDO.Recently, Lido Finance achieved a milestone of one million validators, controlling over 28.5% of all staked Ether. This has made staking more accessible to retail users who would otherwise need substantial capital. Liquid staking protocols like Lido are driving DeFi growth, contributing significantly to the increase in total value locked (TVL) across DeFi platforms, which soared from $36 billion to $97 billion in just one quarter.Despite its success, Lido faces concerns about potential centralization risks, highlighted by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. However, Lido has implemented safeguards to mitigate these risks, reinforcing its position as a leading liquid staking protocol. With robust growth and strategic measures in place, Lido presents a compelling opportunity for investors.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsAfter reaching its ATH during January 2024 at the $4.03 price zone, LDO has had a maximum correction of almost 63%, leading it to test the lower edge of the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from its December 2022 low, located at $1.56.However, after testing the $1.56 level, the LDO price action made a strong bounce to the upside, surpassing even the 0.38 Fibonacci level from its ATH.This bounce is in line with a continuation of LDO's long term uptrend (marked in yellow on the chart), which could be the support to take the price to higher levels in the coming months.Short-Term Price TargetsSeeing that the long term bullish channel has just been respected by LDO price action, and that the 0.38 Fibonacci level from the ATH has already been breached, bullish entries could be sought at the current retracement from the last high, in case the price respects certain zones:- The closest entry to the upside would be in the $2.5 price zone, once the price has rejected the $2.26 area, which corresponds to the 0.38 Fibonacci level from the last high, and also broken the 0.38 Fibonacci level from the ATH.- In case the $2.26 area is broken downwards, the next level to test would be the reversal zone between $1.97 - $1.76. If price rejects this zone to the upside, entry would be at $2.12, which would also imply that the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the ATH has been broken.- The last entry would be in the $1.85 area, with a higher level of risk as this price level would indicate oversold but also weakness, after the price rejects the 0.13 Fibonacci level from the ATH.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

XLM has been staying inside the consolidation levels over the last two years despite its attempt to break through the resistance pegged at the $0.155 mark. A potential upswing for XLM might occur due to its steady trading volume and backed by its focus on fast, cost-effective cross-border transactions, and partnerships with financial institutions. Despite the optimistic forecast, XLM's journey towards $0.681 is expected to be turbulent, given the volatile nature of cryptocurrency.Market Movement Analysis-Market Timing and Volatility:Stellar Lumen attempted to break above its immediate resistance twice, one was last year and the most recent one was recorded in March. XLM\u2019s recent breakout attempt failed as the general market experienced correction following a parabolic move of Bitcoin rising from $42,000 to $73,800 in 6 weeks.-Market Structure:Currently trading below its 100-day simple moving average, XLM is in a bearish phase, struggling to maintain a favourable long-term trend. XLM's performance has been weaker compared to 72% of the top 100 crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, raising questions about its market strength. XLM faces elevated downside risk and potential long-term challenges for now. However, this is an extreme discounted price for every single trader and investor as a huge reward awaits once the market structure shifts.-Capital Rotation:The general market has not made the significant move that was anticipated to attract more investors to the market despite expectations of a rally following the approval of Spot Ether ETFs. Aside from MEME coins rising recently, Stellar\u2019s performance can stand out due to its focus on facilitating cross-border transactions efficiently. Despite the broader market facing challenges including investors' challenge of finding potential cryptocurrency baggers, Stellar can draw more attention for its unique consensus protocol allowing faster transaction times and lower fees, making it a preferred choice for international payments.1-Week Technical AnalysisFollowing a two-week downturn, XLM is sitting potentially on its immediate support as the $0.10 mark reacts when the price revisits it. Historically, there were multiple records of price bouncing off near the $0.10 mark confirming it as its nearest and immediate support.Despite the two attempts to break the market structure and shift the trend, Stellar remains inside the wider range. However, given the strategic developments of XLM, the general market can anticipate a formidable ascent. The longer it consolidates, the bigger it sets the stage for substantial growth.1-Day Technical AnalysisStellar is just gearing up for potential growth. Although no significant move yet from the coin\u2019s price action, XLM could climb to $0.681, a potential 495% increase from its current price. This positive forecast is supported by the cryptocurrency surpassing key resistance levels pegged at $0.15, indicating a likely strong continuation pattern since this will be a multi-year high breakout. As the market watches closely, growing optimism could signal substantial future progress for Stellar.Key Inflection Points-Supports:The immediate support for the price is at $0.10, with subsequent support at $0.091.-Resistance:Surpassing the $0.111 mark could drive the price up to $0.14.Bullish Targets:As the attempt to break out is getting closer, a farther target is set at $0.14.Bearish Targets:If the price fails to break out, the price could potentially visit near the $0.09 level."}]}

However, FTM saw a 50% pullback as the broader market corrected at the end of the first quarter of this year. Recently, a crypto whale made a significant investment in Fantom (FTM) tokens, acquiring 2.818 million FTM for 2.23 million USDC. This investment may be supported by Fantom\u2019s upcoming upgrade to its Opera chain, which was approved after reaching a 66% consensus. The upgrade, aligned with October 2023\u2019s Sonic test net phase, will enable Opera to process 180 million daily transactions with sub-second confirmation times, achieving 2,000 TPS for complex transactions, 4,000 TPS for token swaps, and 10,000 TPS for token transfers. Despite these performance enhancements, Fantom is still in a larger consolidation phase, retesting the flip zone levels after breaking out above its 30-day consolidation range.Market Movement Analysis-Market Interest:With its high-performance blockchain technology for scalability and fast transaction rates, Fantom (FTM) distinguishes itself from other cryptocurrencies. Fantom\u2019s technological prowess makes it a major player in distributed apps, attracting developers and tech enthusiasts seeking innovative solutions. Despite its impressive technological capabilities, Fantom (FTM) has struggled to achieve widespread market acceptance and generate significant financial returns. However, considering market cycles, Fantom is expected to rise after a break in market structure, positioning itself for a swing-high setup.-Market Structure:Currently trading near the 20-day simple moving average on the weekly timeframe, FTM has just retested the previous structure coming from a multi-year high consolidation. This potentially means a new phase has started and it could be the start of the uptrend.-Capital Rotation:Despite the Sonic upgrade\u2014a rebrand accompanied by technical enhancements that will transform Fantom into a new blockchain\u2014FTM still needs to attract more investors to boost its price and volume. Sonic\u2019s impressive transaction speed of 2,000 transactions per second and sub-second finality position Fantom as a strong contender in the blockchain space. However, the general market currently favors volatility, with many MEME coins exploding in popularity. Eventually, the capital inflow is expected to shift, and there is hope that FTM will become the next focus of market interest.1-Week Technical AnalysisFantom (FTM) is currently retesting the previous breakout zone, which is considered the flip side coming from a breakout and then a pullback. The general market sentiment, particularly influenced by the ETH ETF approval and Bitcoin potentially challenging the all-time high, could drive a spike up to the bullish side of the Darvas Box. This move would signal strong bullish momentum and attract more investors and traders, further supporting the upward trend.Considering the current status of the moving averages on the FTM chart, it's noteworthy that the nearest moving average (MA20) has recently been respected over the past few weeks. Should the price stay consistently above this moving average, it could serve as a significant indicator of a potential steady uptrend. Therefore, closely monitoring the price action around the MA20 level could provide valuable insights into the future direction of Fantom.It's also worth considering the status of Fantom's Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has consistently remained above the 50 mark since the sell-off started last March. This suggests a persistent underlying bullish sentiment despite FTM's 50% decline. The RSI's resilience above 50 indicates that the recent pullback could be viewed as a healthy correction within a broader uptrend rather than a bearish reversal.1-Day Technical AnalysisDuring the recent bullish surge across the general market, Fantom's (FTM) attempt to break above the middle line of the Darvas Box on the daily timeframe faced rejection, as indicated by the candlestick patterns. However, there has been a notable shift in FTM's overall trend since last week, with all moving averages realigning and the price sitting above all of them. Despite FTM\u2019s price still being under the bearish trajectory of the Darvas Box, it is attempting to establish a higher-low structure. This could potentially indicate a discounted price relative to the general market, offering a buying opportunity for investors.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$0.7586 is the immediate support level, with $0.6418 following closely behind.-Resistance:$0.96 is the next immediate resistance considering this is a whole number resistance, followed by $1.14Bullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period, is set at $1.15.Bearish Targets:A break below $0.75 could potentially lead the price back to the Darvas Box support pegged at $0.56."}]}

However, the recent surge to 6 million daily transactions by late May 2024 represents a substantial shift. This increase is not just a random spike but the result of sustained growth, with total transactions rising from 300 million in late August 2023 to an impressive 1.3 billion recently. This historical context underscores the protocol's growing utility and adoption in the crypto ecosystem.Significance of NEAR's SurgeThe reported surge in daily transactions to 6 million is a pivotal moment for Near Protocol. This growth trajectory builds on the historical context of steady increase, indicating that Near has transitioned from a phase of gradual adoption to a more rapid expansion. This surge is particularly important as it reflects broader trends within the ecosystem, such as the doubling of wallet creations from 30 million in September 2023 to 75 million recently. Moreover, the integration of NEAR with OKX's Web3 wallet on May 28, which facilitates seamless transfers to 95 different blockchains, likely played a crucial role in accelerating this transaction growth. These developments suggest a robust infrastructure and increasing interoperability, making NEAR more attractive to both users and developers.NEAR's Future: TVL InsightsThe significant increase in daily transactions and wallet creations bodes well for Near Protocol\u2019s future, particularly concerning its TVL and Market Cap. The rise in transaction volume and active wallets indicates higher user engagement and activity, which typically correlates with increased TVL as more assets are deployed within the ecosystem. The NEAR token's substantial 350% gain over the past year, despite a recent 4% drop, reflects growing investor confidence. However, sustained growth depends on continued user retention and the effectiveness of partnerships, like those with Cosmose AI and Sweat Economy. While these partnerships enhance Near's ecosystem, there's a potential downside if the rapid user acquisition does not translate into long-term engagement and transaction stability.Competitive AdvantagesThe integration with OKX and significant increases in transaction volume and wallet creation demonstrate Near's robust ecosystem and user appeal. Unlike FTM and KAS, NEAR has shown a remarkable ability to scale rapidly while maintaining interoperability across multiple blockchains. Furthermore, the success of applications like Kai-Ching and Sweat Economy, which have driven substantial user activity, underscores Near's diverse use cases and strong developer community. However, it is essential to note that the competitive landscape is dynamic, and NEAR must continue to innovate and address potential scalability issues to maintain its edge. As with any fast-growing protocol, the sustainability of these gains is contingent on ongoing user engagement and network performance."}]}

The Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA) was established to address the growing need for comprehensive education on blockchain technology, decentralization, and Polkadot's unique offerings. Since its inception, PBA has launched multiple cohorts, each designed to equip participants with in-depth knowledge and practical skills related to its development tools and Web3 principles. This educational initiative aligns with the broader vision of fostering a decentralized internet and ensuring that its developer community remains well-informed and proficient in utilizing its technology stack.Impact of Singapore LaunchThe announcement of the fifth cohort of PBA in Singapore marks a significant milestone in Polkadot's ongoing educational endeavors. This cohort is particularly notable for its extensive curriculum, featuring 184 hours of lectures and the involvement of 18 experienced instructors. The choice of Singapore as the main program location underscores the strategic importance of the Asian market, which is seen as a dynamic hub for blockchain innovation and adoption. By offering both in-person and remote learning options, PBA aims to make its courses accessible to a global audience, reinforcing its commitment to inclusivity. This expansion of educational efforts not only aims to enhance the skills of current developers but also seeks to attract new talent to the Polkadot ecosystem.Future Implications for DOTBy educating a new wave of developers, Polkadot is likely to see an increase in the number and quality of projects built on its platform, potentially boosting its TVL as more decentralized applications (dApps) are deployed. This influx of talent can drive innovation within the Polkadot ecosystem, leading to more robust and scalable solutions that could attract further investment. However, the impact on market cap may be less immediate, as it depends on broader market conditions and investor sentiment. Nonetheless, a well-educated and active developer community is a crucial factor in sustaining long-term growth and adoption.Polkadot's Edge Through LearningWhile both ATOM and QNT have strong technical foundations and active development communities, Polkadot\u2019s structured educational programs provide a more formal and accessible pathway for developers to learn and contribute to the ecosystem. This focus on education and inclusivity not only enhances developer engagement but also helps to build a more cohesive and collaborative community. However, it is essential to remain cautious, as the success of these educational initiatives depends on their ability to consistently attract and retain talented individuals. Moreover, the competitive landscape in blockchain technology is ever-evolving, and Polkadot must continuously innovate to maintain its edge over ATOM, QNT, and other emerging protocols.By investing in comprehensive educational programs like the PBA, Polkadot is not just preparing for immediate growth but is also laying a strong foundation for sustained development and competitive advantage in the rapidly evolving blockchain space."}]}

This move leverages its high transaction speed and low costs, making it ideal for cost-effective payments and attracting significant institutional interest. The increasing activity on Solana, with over 1 million active addresses, further demonstrates its robust adoption.Building on this momentum, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's prediction of inevitable Solana ETFs highlights the platform's growing prominence. His optimism, coupled with the anticipation of a $5 trillion crypto market, suggests its price could reach $1,000. This potential is bolstered by its focus on expanding financial accessibility through scalable technology.The potential approval of a spot ETF could further amplify demand, setting a new market standard. Legislative efforts like the Financial Innovation and Technology Act could expedite this process despite opposition from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, and the Biden administration, who believe there is insufficient protection for consumers and investors.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsSolana has continued its uptrend since its October 2023 low, from where it has risen approximately 900%, reaching its 2024 high at the $210 price zone. This high coincides almost perfectly with $206, which is the end of the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) drawn from its ATH.It has recently been subject to increased volatility given the price level it has reached, retreating towards the $129 level, where the reversal zone drawn from the last low is located. After rejecting this zone to the upside, the price has again broken the $164 resistance, re-entering the reversal zone from the ATH.If this zone is maintained, as well as the bullish trend line it has been following, the price could reach again the upper range at $206 and even surpass it, which would leave the door open to a bull run towards the ATH and even higher targets.Short-Term Price TargetsGiven that the price of SOL is currently entering the reversal zone drawn from its 2024 high, which is between $173 and $190, the following options could be used to attempt a long trade, always with proper risk management as the price is in a zone of indecision:-The riskiest trade according to our strategy would be with entry at $175 after breaking the last relative high and the 0.61 FIbonacci level. Given that this entry would be within the reversal zone, it would be subject to a high risk of rejection of the zone in case Bitcoin generates a fall in the short term.-One could wait for the price to pull back to for example the reversal zone from the last relative low and make an entry at $159 once the price rejects that zone.-The most confirming entry would be at $191, once the reversal zone from the 2024 high is breached. One thing to keep in mind with this entry is that the price may reverse at the $196-206 area which is the final boundary of the reversal zone from the ATH and where the 2024 high is also located, which would be likely to form a double top and generate a decline.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

In February, ALGO attempted to break above its 52-week high resistance during a short-term rally, but the effort saw no follow-through as the general market experienced a pullback, exacerbated by a geopolitical conflict between Iran and Israel in the second week of April. Recently, Algorand launched ALGOKIT, designed to ease the transition for Web 2 developers to Web 3 and attract developers from other chains interested in experimenting with Algorand. Despite these advancements, ALGO still faces challenges in shifting its momentum. However, this new development and increased adaptability could attract growing interest from investors, offering a potentially attractive investment at a discounted price.Market Movement Analysis-General Market Sentiment:BTC's price started a new surge above $70,000, sparking increased activity in altcoins. Many cryptocurrencies turned green, creating a positive atmosphere ahead of the ETH ETF launch, which seems to be setting the stage for new peaks. However, ALGO remains dormant within its consolidation phase and has not surpassed its 52-week high, unlike some other coins that have already broken market structure and are potentially poised in an uptrend.-Investor Interest:Despite its economic efficiency with a network fee policy charging around 0.001 ALGO per transaction, which promotes high transaction volume, ALGO's price action remains sluggish, hovering near the $0.17 mark. Even with the anticipated positive impact of both BTC and ETH ETFs, ALGO still hasn't attracted the desired level of investor interest needed to increase its price and trading volume.-Market Stance:Algorand\u2019s low transaction costs, typically around 0.001 ALGO per transaction, make it highly economical for handling high volumes of transactions. Additionally, ALGO stands out in the crowded Layer 1 blockchain space with its impressive performance metrics. However, its price action lags behind due to its recent market structure, where accumulation continues. The accumulation stage is expected to conclude once the price breaks above the $0.30 level, potentially signaling the start of a new upward trend.1-Week Technical AnalysisALGO\u2019s 52-week high breakout attempt failed as no followthrough happened since the general market experienced a sell-off last March. The price needs to break above the $0.30 mark to make a new structure or a shift in momentum.ALGO is currently situated under two moving averages but the 50-day moving average is potentially supporting the price. It has also established its immediate support pegged at $0.175. It could take a little while before holders reap the reward but a potentially 9x fold awaits.Considering the current status of the relative strength index, it has not breached the middle line of the RSI. It could mean longer consolidation ahead. However, the price has not created a lower low structure and is currently establishing the higher low structure of the weekly timeframe. Once this setup materializes, the next move should be the higher high of the structure which should break above the $0.30 resistance.1-Day Technical AnalysisFrom a lower time frame perspective, ALGO has been in a one-candle consolidation range between $0.1472 and $0.1936 for the past 53 days. Despite several attempts to break above the high of this range, the price has failed to successfully breach it, even with fundamental improvements. For short-term holders, the price needs to break above the $0.20 mark to confirm a break of market structure and exit the accumulation stage. The next resistance level is pegged at $0.212, coinciding with the 100-day moving average. A typical scenario would see the price break above the 100-day moving average, then retest it by making a short-term consolidation before heading to the next resistance level at $0.28.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$0.171 is the immediate support level, with $0.1472 following closely behind.-Resistance:The price is nearing the immediate resistance level, and the next projected resistance is at $0.211.Bullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period, is set at $0.232.Bearish Targets:A break below $0.171 could potentially lead the price back to the Darvas Box support at $0.1472."}]}

This integration solves the \u201ccold start problem\u201d and simplifies onboarding by handling KYC and compliance. Akash Gupta of Ava Labs believes this will enhance global crypto adoption, making digital currencies more accessible.Analysts are bullish on AVAX due to its technical indicators and upcoming developments like Initial Chain Offerings (ICOs).

With strong buying interest reflected in the Fear & Greed Index, Avalanche stands poised for significant growth.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsAVAX has had a maximum rise of approximately 450% from its October 2023 low to its 2024 high, which coincides with the price zone of the 0.38 Fibonacci level traced from its ATH.After this rise and using this level as a clear ceiling, it had a maximum fall of almost 55% towards the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci Levels) from its October 2023 low, in the $30.8 area. This area also coincides with the 0.23 Fibonacci level of the April 2022 high.The fact that the price action has rejected this zone to the upside could be a good sign of a continuation of the uptrend.Of course, this $31 zone would have to be held to the upside for the chances of a trend reversal to increase.Short-Term Price TargetsGiven that AVAX has twice used the $30.4 price zone, this is the main support for the price currently.Different entries could be considered for AVAX, according to the price development:The closest and with the highest level of confirmation would be once the price surpasses the $38 level which coincides with the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high.Another entry would be at $34.5, in case of a price retracement and close to the 0.13 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high.The riskiest entry with the lowest level of confirmation would be at the $31.5 price zone, once the price rejects the $30.4 level again in case of a sharp fall to that zone.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

The current price is an astonishing 81,751.77% higher than this all-time low.The project stands out due to two key risk mitigation factors. Firstly, it had a fair launch, with no preferential treatment for founders or venture capitalists. Token supply is notably decentralized. Second, unlike Bitcoin\u2019s four-year halving cycle, KASPA undergoes a halving event annually. With 83%of its supply already in circulation, the project is on the verge of a significant reduction in new token issuance.Since the start of the 2023 rally, KASPA has consistently hit new all-time highs. A notable pattern in its behavior is the tendency to undergo prolonged consolidations before making higher-high structures. Its most recent consolidation lasted roughly 80 trading days before it surged to its current all-time high of $0.1896. Now, it took about 3 months before the price challenged the recent all-time high and potentially making new records of new ATH prices.Market Movement AnalysisInvestor Interest:Kaspa crypto\u2019s rally toward its all-time high could be backed by a surge in its trading volume, highlighting the massive adoption of the KAS. It also boasts a market cap of over $3.5b, demonstrating its dominance in the crypto market. With the Binance listing set to feature mid/low tokens, Kaspa might yet see a rise in its value, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies to buy. KASPA\u2019s current market performance is noteworthy, ranking 26th on CoinMarketCap, and with a daily trading volume of $216,316,409.Halving Event:Unlike Bitcoin\u2019s halving that happens every four years,the platform undergoes an annual halving event, which has previously led to a significant price surge. Anticipation for future halving events may push prices up further. Since June started, KAS has witnessed a surge in trading volume. For example, on 3rd June, the altcoin\u2019s daily trading volume totaled $165 million, representing its highest level since November 2023, according to Santiment\u2019s data.Scalability and Speed:Kaspa\u2019s ghostdog protocol promises scalability speed and their future goals include increasing block creation rate and improving archival nodes for easier access to historical data. The network\u2019s ability to handle transactions simultaneously boosts the number of blocks created each second, making Kaspa ideal for daily transactions.1-Week Technical AnalysisKASPA\u2019s recent run-up started in May as it established immediate support near the $0.10 mark. The price continued moving upward smoothly, breaching the middle line of the Darvas Box. Currently, the price sits above the 20-day moving average, a setup that is likely to attract short-term and mid-term holders, especially given the break above the middle line of the Darvas Box. Notably, its relative strength index (RSI) has only dropped below 50 once but quickly recovered and is now pointing towards overbought levels.However, if the price does not break the all-time high resistance at $0.189, a potential correction could occur, pulling the price back near the $0.16 mark. This scenario is something investors should be aware of when considering their entry and exit strategies.1-Day Technical AnalysisKaspa (KAS) recently attempted to break above its all-time high price level but was unsuccessful. Despite this rejection, the cryptocurrency remains extremely bullish, as indicated by its relative strength index (RSI) staying above the overbought levels. When the RSI remains above 70, it suggests bullish momentum and the potential for a parabolic move, with the price rapidly hitting new all-time highs.One scenario to expect is the formation of a classic cup and handle pattern, where the price might pull back to around the $0.16 level. If the price establishes immediate support at this level, the anticipation of the cup and handle pattern increases. This setup provides a good entry point prior to a breakout buy opportunity.Key Inflection PointsSupports:$0.1438 is the immediate support level, with $0.113 following closely behind.Resistance:The nearest resistance is on the fibonacci 1.618 level pegged at $0.244 once price breaks above the all-time high.Bullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period, is set at $0.244.Bearish Targets:A break below $0.1438 could potentially lead the price down to $0.0113."}]}

This move will enhance the adoption of FRAX in diverse applications like trading and payments, offering Cosmos users a decentralized alternative to USDC. The integration with Noble supports the broader strategy of becoming a pivotal player in multiple blockchain ecosystems.Aligned with this expansion, the protocol aims to boost its total value locked (TVL) to $100 billion by 2026 through its singularity roadmap, which includes launching 23 new layer 3s. This ambitious plan also involves reviving mechanisms to share protocol revenue with veFXS stakers and enhancing liquidity for the FXS governance token, further solidifying its presence in the DeFi space.To bolster this strategy, the team is considering a proposal to distribute protocol fees to veFXS stakers, following Uniswap\u2019s lead. This move could significantly increase the value and liquidity of its native tokens. If approved, it will further align with the mission to support its ecosystem, drive broader adoption in the DeFi space, and meet its ambitious TVL goals.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsFRX has had a 106% maximum rise from its September 2023 low to reach its 2024 high in the $11 price zone. With that high, the price has started to develop a bearish channel in which it is still in.After the 2024 high, the price action has declined to approximately $3.34, which represents the 1.27 Fibonacci level from its last low. This point reached on the downside constituted a new ATL, but was rejected to the upside and eventually positioned above the main support at $4.1, an area that has been visited on countless occasions and which has served as a floor for further rallies.If the price pulls back below the $4.0 level, this would be a bearish and weak signal, which would take the price further down to possibly the $1.3 area.For there to be a chance of a bounce to the upside, price must hold the $4.0 area.Short-Term Price TargetsGiven that the price is close to its main support, and that it has just surpassed the 0.13 Fibonacci level traced from its 2024 high, two bullish entries could be attempted to take advantage of a possible rebound at least towards the upper zone of the descending channel that FRX has been tracing:The first and with less confirmation at $4.6, above the 0.13 Fibonacci level mentioned.The entry with the highest confirmation at $5.3, once the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high has been reached and the last relative high has been surpassed.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

The lack of price movement is tied to the absence of updates in the SEC vs. Ripple case. XRP remains near its immediate support or the low end of its range over the past several weeks, despite investor anticipation surrounding its motion to seal, which could influence the penalty Ripple must pay for allegedly breaching US securities laws. Furthermore, Judge Katherine Failla is expected to grant the Motion for Interlocutory Appeal filed by Coinbase, potentially allowing Coinbase to appeal against the Motion to Dismiss ruling. This could challenge the SEC's stance on the securities status of cryptocurrencies, potentially setting XRP up for a price upswing.Market Movement AnalysisInvestor Interest:The SEC initially proposed a $2 billion penalty and a ban on XRP sales to institutional investors, which Ripple disputed, suggesting the penalty be around $10 million. Despite the dispute, certain investors would not want to participate in assets with lawsuits.XRP ETF:Ripple's president has stated that an XRP ETF is inevitable if a positive court outcome clarifies regulatory issues. ETFs for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum provide investors with exposure to these assets without the need for direct purchase, simplifying the investment process and reducing certain associated risks. This development allows investors to consider ETF products beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the launch of a spot XRP ETF is not listed among Ripple's top priorities in its three-year roadmap, contributing to the sluggish price movement of XRP.1-Week Technical AnalysisRipple\u2019s recent consolidation stayed under a single bar ranging between $0.75 - $0.46 over the last 11 months. Despite the previous sell-offs last April, Ripple has managed to establish an immediate support close to the 100-day moving average and the price pegged at $0.50. The price has stayed on this level for the past 53 days with several breakout attempts recorded. Despite the rejection of the breakout attempts, XRP has potentially established a higher-low series which could potentially be the start of a shift in momentum. XRP needs to break the market structure by breaching the $0.55 mark coinciding the break above the 100-day moving average in order to start the shift in trend.1-Day Technical AnalysisRipple has attempted to break the market structure three times on the daily timeframe, but each attempt was met with rejection at the immediate resistance level of $0.55. Despite these multiple breakout attempts, the price consistently bounced back to higher levels, forming a series of higher lows. This pattern is a classic example of a flag pattern, with a trendline below the candles acting as support. As long as the price stays above this trendline, Ripple\u2019s potential for an upward move remains strong.Key Inflection PointsSupports:$0.515is the immediate support level, with $0.4790 following closely behind.Resistance:The nearest and immediate resistance is pegged at $0.55 where the multiple breakout attempts happened.Bullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period, is set at $0.65.Bearish Targets:A break below $0.515 could potentially lead the price down to $0.4790."}]}

This move is supported by a significant inflow of $886 million into Bitcoin ETFs on June 4, 2024, serving as a bullish catalyst and shaking Bitcoin out of its previous lethargy. However, the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) metric is decreasing, suggesting that users are not conducting enough transaction volume to justify the current Bitcoin prices. Despite strong fundamentals, futures market participants have remained on the sidelines, with a subdued funding rate.While some factors contribute to the slow price movement, optimism remains among crypto-focused firms. For instance, Bybit, a global crypto exchange, reportedly plans to allow Chinese expatriates to open accounts and trade, aiming to meet the growing demand for secure and user-friendly crypto trading solutions. This move could further bolster market sentiment and drive additional interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.Technical Analysis InsightsWith Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume continuing to stay below average, a new all-time high is unlikely to be recorded soon. This is due to the anticipation of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, as such changes could favor speculative assets like Bitcoin. Currently, investors remain on the sidelines, waiting for the perfect timing in the market, as rate cuts are expected to happen next month. This cautious approach is contributing to the subdued trading activity and slow price movement despite other positive factors in the market.Ranging from $71,556 to $66,058, Bitcoin is recently trading close to the 20-day moving average after its significant move following the circulation of rumors about the Ethereum ETF approval on May 20th. Since then, BTC has been in a very narrow consolidation phase.Bitcoin's recent break above the $70,000 mark is attributed to positive macroeconomic indicators and growing interest from institutional investors. This marks the longest rise in three months for the cryptocurrency. As BTC potentially challenges the recent all-time high of $73,800, the $70,000 mark should act as immediate support to sustain the momentum. This support level is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and driving further upward movement.Potential Weekend Outcomes1. BTC.Dom has been hovering near the 100-day moving average on the daily timeframe for the last 3 weeks. It may have established an immediate support as the $2,300 mark kept bouncing the price back. On a longer timeframe, the weekly timeframe, BTC.Dom currently hovers and trails on the 20-day moving average. It can be seen historically that the price trail on the MA20 since June of 2022.2. While BTC\u2019s price draw close near the recent all-time high price, BTC.Dom is still struggling to establish its new market structure as it remains under a one-candle consolidation with roughly 5% range. A scenario that is likely to happen is that Bitcoin breaks the all-time high while BTC.Dom breaks its market structure. These two normally correlate with each other thus confirming Bitcoin\u2019s next leg up.3. BTC is less than 4% away from its previous all-time high and this could happen anytime if a driver or any catalyst pops out of nowhere that would drive the general market interest towards Bitcoin.SnapshotBTCDom consistently remains above the prior breakout zone at $2,300 and is now thriving to breach a new market structure if it breaks above the $2,400 mark.BTCDom\u2019s relative strength index continues to stay below the middle line which potentially connotes a longer consolidation period.Bitcoin is slowly moving on an upward trajectory and might create a new all-time high price soon.Weekend and Monday OutlookThe previous all-time high of Bitcoin is just a few percentage points away from today\u2019s price. Although the US session has not yet started, today\u2019s closing will be crucial for determining next week\u2019s potential price action. Despite a potential make-or-break scenario over the weekend, Bitcoin is already out of the danger zone as it stays above the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box. Additionally, it is in a narrow consolidation phase near the resistance of a mini-Darvas Box, suggesting a strong position for potential upward movement.Forecast FlashIf BTCDom breaks above $2,400 price level, a potential 4% move can happen to Bitcoin over the weekend making new all-time high prices."}]}

This aligns with its strategic roadmap and is expected to boost decentralized decision-making. Increased whale transactions have also been noted, which indicates rising interest from influential investors, and signals potential price reversals and positive market sentiment.Founder Charles Hoskinson highlights the Ouroboros Leios upgrade amidst recent criticisms. This new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism aims to enhance scalability and transaction efficiency, solidifying Cardano's position as a leading blockchain. Additionally, Hoskinson proposed a potential integration with Bitcoin Cash via a poll, garnering significant community support. This \"partnerchain\" concept could merge Cardano\u2019s advanced technology with Bitcoin Cash\u2019s Proof of Work, enhancing both networks' capabilities.Featured Cryptocurrency of the Week: ADAThis Week's Breakthroughs:As a major highlight in the ecosystem, late last week saw the release of the UTXO-HD update to version 0.10.0, which represents an important step for Cardano, allowing developers to access more data and better contribute to the development of the blockchain.The price of ADA finally woke up this week, after two previous weeks where it had seen a decline of approximately 14% to revisit key supports in the $0.44 area.With high volatility in the markets heading into Friday mornings 7/6, when the US Non Farm Payrolls and Unemployment rate was released, Cardano seemed to have barely heard that the Non Farm Payrolls came out stronger than expected, although unemployment was ultimately higher than expected at 4%, a figure that had not been reached for over two years.The price barely hinted at a retracement of the strong almost 5% bullish candle it had posted in the last 4 hours prior to the employment data.Technical AnalysisRecent Price Movements:ADA has had a positive week and at the time of writing this report is up +9.25%.It is assumed that a combination of negative sentiment in previous weeks, the release of the UTXO-HD update during the previous week, and touching key support in the $0.44 area may have generated this upward momentum in ADA's price.An important point is the clear rejection of both the reversal zone from the October 2023 low and the 0.13 FIbonacci level from the 2024 high. This could start an interesting upward move.In fact, the $0.47 level which was the first entry given in this week's ADA report has already been breached.The 0.23 Fibonacci level drawn from the 2024 high at $0.495 / $0.50 will be a key resistance to watch for a possible bullish continuation in the price of ADA.Future PerspectivesAs ADA has rejected the 0.13 Fibonacci level and the reversal zone from the October 2023 low on the upside, the probability of a bullish bounce has improved considerably.The first entry point has been breached, it remains to be seen what happens at the $0.50 level which would be the first key resistance to be overcome to effectively break higher.The next entry with further confirmation level would be at $0.52, once the last relative highs and the 0.23 Fibonacci level traced from the 2024 high have been breached.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesSolana (SOL):With a good start to the week, SOL posted a rise of more than 6%, but on Thursday and Friday it has rejected downwards the $174 area, where the 0.61 Fibonacci level (or the beginning of the reversal zone comprising the range of 0.61 to 0.78 Fibonacci levels) from its last high of 2024 is located. This would not be a good sign for a bullish development in the SOL price in the short term, although above $160, the odds continue to lean to the upside.Avalanche (AVAX):AVAX continues to hold the bullish trend line described in the weekly report and the reversal zone from its last low, which at the moment maintains its likelihood of heading higher again. The zones to monitor would be $33.5 (0.13 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high), and $30 which is where the reversal zone from the October 2023 low begins."}]}

This plan includes the launch of 23 new layer 3 solutions and revitalising mechanisms to share protocol revenue with veFXS stakers. Additionally, it focuses on enhancing liquidity for the FXS governance token, which will further cement its standing in the DeFi sector.In line with this expansion, Frax Finance is making a significant leap by entering the Cosmos ecosystem, bringing its FRAX and sFRAX tokens through the asset issuance chain, Noble. This integration is poised to increase the use of these tokens in various applications such as trading and payments, providing Cosmos users with a decentralised alternative to USDC. The collaboration with Noble is part of a larger strategy to establish a strong presence across multiple blockchain ecosystems, which also includes a team proposal to allocate protocol fees to veFXS stakers, inspired by Uniswap's model. If implemented, this could significantly boost the value and liquidity of Frax's native tokens.Featured Cryptocurrency of the Week: FRXThis Week's Breakthroughs:FXS has maintained its short term uptrend during this week, starting this Friday June 7th with an interesting rise that at the time of writing this report accumulates more than 8%, and that during Friday morning was very close to reach the 0.23 Fibonacci level from its 2024 high and the second entry point to the upside given in the weekly report on Frax Finance.It remains to be seen what the market decides about this rise, given that the mentioned level just rejected is the strongest resistance for the price in the short term and which threatens a sustainable upward rally for the FXS price.Technical AnalysisRecent Price Movements:Currently, FXS has rejected the $5.3 price zone, bouncing down to the 0.23 Fibonacci level finally, and dragged down by the general market trend as Bitcoin has fallen a maximum of 4.5% in the last 3 hours.While on the 15-minute chart, it would appear that Bitcoin made a sweep of leveraged longs towards the reversal zone traced from its last low on May 31, this has not been positive for altcoins in general, nor for FXS in particular, which posted a decline of almost 20% in the same time period.At the time of writing, it is recovering above the 0.13 Fibonacci level traced from its 2024 high, which would be a good sign of a near-term recovery.For FXS to continue its short-term uptrend, not to mention the apparent sweep of the past few hours, it should hold the $4.47 price zone, where the aforementioned 0.13 Fibonacci level resides. In case it does not hold it, it could head back to levels close to its ATL, and in case of breaking this one, possibly visit $3.34 / $3.00.Future PerspectivesGiven the apparent sweep of the last few hours, should there be a rebound to the upside in Bitcoin and the altcoin market in general, entries at low FXS points could be taken advantage of.FXS price should bounce to the upside at the $4.47 level which is the 0.13 Fibonacci level mentioned above, to attempt an entry to the upside at $4.6 with high risk and low confirmation level. Proper risk management (low % account exposure) should be used for this entry.In case of seeking a higher confirmation entry, the $5.3 level could be used, once the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high is breached.These entries would aim for targets starting at $6.37.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesLido (LDO):LDO has also declined along with Bitcoin's sweep to test the $1.83 area, which coincides millimetrically with the 0.13 Fibonacci level traced from its ATH. This area would be ideal to attempt a long trade with scalping entry towards levels from $3.00 as a first target, butin case of attempting it, it would be essential to maintain adequate risk managementsince the risk level for such an operation is very high.Rocket Pool (RPL):RPL has also pulled back to an area near the 0.13 Fibonacci level from its 2024 high and from the first proposed entry in the weekly analysis in the $21 area. For the price to have an upward bounce, it should hold the $20.3 area in the short term, or regain it in case it loses it to attempt a trade to the upside."}]}

These upgrades are part of the network\u2019s broader strategy to facilitate interoperability among various blockchains through its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Previous upgrades have introduced significant features like IBC, which allows different blockchains to communicate and exchange value seamlessly, and the Gravity DEX, which provides decentralized exchange capabilities. Each upgrade typically involves rigorous testing and community input to ensure robustness and reliability. However, the dynamic nature of blockchain technology means that even well-planned upgrades can encounter unforeseen issues, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring and swift problem resolution.Recent Upgrade's Critical RoleThe recent v17 upgrade of the Cosmos Hub, which aimed to integrate the Liquid Staking Module, underscores the network\u2019s commitment to advancing its staking capabilities and enhancing user participation in governance. Liquid staking allows users to stake their ATOM coins while maintaining liquidity, thus improving capital efficiency. However, during this upgrade, a vulnerability in the Liquid Staking Module caused a temporary halt in the blockchain\u2019s operation. This incident is a reminder of the inherent risks associated with implementing new features in complex systems. The quick identification and resolution of the issue by the development teams, Informal Systems and Hypha Cosmos, align with the Cosmos Hub\u2019s historical emphasis on transparency and continuous improvement. The forthcoming post-mortem report will provide valuable insights into the nature of the vulnerability and the steps taken to mitigate it, further demonstrating the network's dedication to security and accountability.Future Implications for ATOMThe swift recovery from the outage is likely to have mixed implications for ATOM\u2019s future. On the positive side, the prompt resolution and commitment to transparency may reinforce investor and user confidence in the network\u2019s resilience and governance. This could potentially stabilize or even enhance ATOM\u2019s market cap and TVL in the short to medium term. However, the incident also exposes the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with protocol upgrades, which could lead to caution among investors and users. The market\u2019s reaction will depend heavily on the detailed findings of the post-mortem report and the perceived effectiveness of the measures implemented to prevent similar issues in the future. Any lingering concerns about the network\u2019s stability could dampen enthusiasm and impact both TVL and market cap negatively."}]}

Bitcoin has been in a very narrow 8% range since the news of the ETH spot ETF approval. Despite last week's significant inflows, with Bitcoin investments accounting for nearly $1.97 billion out of the $2 billion total in crypto inflows, BTC has not made any substantial moves.The recent drop was notable, with BTC declining roughly 5% in just 5 hours. However, on longer timeframes, Bitcoin's structure remains strong. This has resulted in a healthy pullback, with the price hovering close to the 20-day moving average on the daily timeframe.Market Movement Analysis-General Market Interest:As Bitcoin\u2019s price remains sluggish, a decline in on-chain activities has been observed over the past three days. The number of daily active Bitcoin addresses has been trending downward since March, recently dropping from over 1 million to around 600,000. Although there have been brief spikes in daily active addresses, they were unsustained. Additionally, the number of new Bitcoin addresses has been declining since January 2024. The lack of significant price movement in Bitcoin has contributed to the drop in both active and new addresses.-Capital Rotation:Last week, investors poured $2 billion into crypto products, predominantly into Bitcoin, according to CoinShares. Of the $2 billion, Ethereum saw inflows of only $69 million, while BTC received the majority, amounting to $1.97 billion. The remaining inflows were allocated to other cryptocurrencies. Despite this influx of investment, BTC has not made a significant move yet. However, as long as BTC remains above the middle line of the Darvas Box, it stays within the safe zone of consolidation.1-Week Technical AnalysisBitcoin slightly struggles to break above the $72,000 mark as an attempt occurred last Friday, June 07. The volume was significant enough as it was above the daily average but the general market sentiment cannot sustain the short-term breakout attempt.Bitcoin's weekly price action indicates a healthy consolidation and might potentially pull back close to the $65,000 mark or near the middle line of the Darvas Box. The projected pullback area also coincides with the 20-day moving average of the weekly timeframe as it draws near it.Lastly, Bitcoin's relative strength index (RSI) is encountering resistance at the overbought level, with the 70 mark acting as a ceiling. The projected overbought level is pegged at the $71,400 mark, a price where the structure would confirm a breakout of Bitcoin's recent consolidation.1-Day Technical AnalysisLast week, Bitcoin dipped below the $70,000 mark, causing short-term fear in the general market. Over the past few days, Bitcoin has approached the low of its recent range at $66,058, with resistance at $71,432. BTC has continued to decline slowly, with the drop percentage remaining within 3%. This gradual decline could indicate institutions are trying to prevent a wild sell-off, suggesting a healthy pullback. Once the dust settles, the general market may begin to re-accumulate at a discounted price, setting the stage for the next upward movement.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$65,432 as immediate support, followed by $60,803.-Resistance:BTC needs to break above $71,400 to confirm its next leg up and to stay above the bullish side of the box.Bullish Targets:Should the price exceed $73,800, it could pave the way for a rally up to $85,176. This projection aligns with the Fibonacci extension at the 1.618 level, indicating a strong potential for upward momentum.Bearish Targets:In the event of a significant negative catalyst, driving BTC's price below $60,000, we could witness market-wide turmoil. Such a scenario might prompt Bitcoin to retrace and test the $50,000 support level once again."}]}

Despite the SEC's decision to allow spot Ether ETFs, the expected increase in Ethereum buying has not materialized. Cryptocurrency investment products saw nearly $2 billion in inflows over the past week, totaling over $4 billion in the last month, but Ethereum recorded only $69 million of these inflows. This is due in part to the general market experiencing a short-term sell-off after Bitcoin's breakout attempt failed, causing fear that affected other coins, including ETH, which saw a 3.47% decline. Currently, Ethereum is hovering near the $3,600 price level.Market Movement Analysis-General Market Sentiment:Bitcoin recently experienced a short-term pullback, impacting the broader market and causing ETHEREUM and SOLANA to decline by roughly 4% - 5% from their recent highs. Prior to last week\u2019s sell-off, several cryptocurrencies were in a short-term rally from the lows of their ranges, but no significant breakout attempts were observed among most of these movers. This reflects a cautiously bullish environment, with holders aggressively taking profits.-ETH/BTC Market Structure:The price of Ethereum (ETH) relative to Bitcoin (BTC) is still falling, even though it is not declining in USD terms. The relationship between Ethereum and Bitcoin remains of interest, as the ETH/BTC price has been dropping since the beginning of June. However, this decline appears to be a normal correction, potentially setting ETH/BTC up for its next leg up. Despite this market structure, Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto markets.-Ethereum\u2019s Market Structure:As Ethereum\u2019s price continues to slowly decline, it has presented a buying opportunity for large investors, leading to increased accumulation by whale wallets. Analysis of major Ethereum addresses shows a growth in wallets holding over 10,000 ETH since the end of May. Despite this accumulation by whale wallets, the price of Ethereum has yet to make a significant move and remains in a narrow consolidation.1-Week Technical AnalysisEthereum's weekly price action potentially forms a three-black candle pattern for the candle formation. This is a classic pullback pattern for traders who make decisions based on the movement of each candle partnered with support and resistance for efficiency. As Ethereum draws closer to the middle line of the larger range, it indicates a potential bounce zone coinciding with the 20-day moving average.Despite the pullback phase of Ethereum, the volume provides a small context confirming the decline is just a correction preparing Ethereum to its next leg up. The volume over the past two weeks is even lower than the average weekly volume.Lastly, Ethereums relative strength index continues to hover above the 60 mark. Despite the previous week\u2019s price action including March and April sell-offs, its RSI remains to stay above the middle line or above RSI50. This indicates that the momentum has not changed yet for the bulls.1-Day Technical AnalysisOn the daily timeframe, Ethereum is in a one-candle consolidation range between $3,525 and $3,949. Currently, the price is approaching the low end of this range, with potential support from both the 100-day and 50-day moving averages. These moving averages are also about to cross the middle line of the larger Darvas Box, indicating a bullish trajectory within the consolidation. A potential bounce could occur near the $3,500 price level, as this was historically the breakout zone for Ethereum during a 30-day consolidation period last April.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$3,500 as immediate support, followed by $3,00-Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $3,949.Bullish Targets:At the moment, the nearest target for ETH is projected at $4,000.Bearish Targets:A break below $3,500 could potentially lead the price down to $3,000."}]}

A collaboration with Mercuryo and Meteor Wallet aims to streamline crypto transactions, potentially boosting user adoption and DeFi services. Despite internal restructuring and social media concerns, the protocol's resilience and growth potential remain strong. Aurora, leveraging NEAR\u2019s infrastructure, connects seamlessly with Ethereum, showcasing the innovative capabilities of projects based on this Layer 1 blockchain.Building on this momentum, OKX Wallet\u2019s integration further expanded the ecosystem, as it enabled easy access to 300 million TVL on chain via OKX Wallet's Discover portal. This integration supports over 95 blockchains, solidifying OKX Wallet's position as a versatile multi-chain wallet, and attracting attention to the NEAR ecosystem.However, daily transaction volume has experienced volatility, with notable drops and rebounds. After stabilizing at around 6 million daily transactions in May, the volume rebounded to 8 million. Peaks in transaction volume suggest heightened activity and user engagement, indicating a potential bullish trend if it reaches 10 million daily transactions.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsNEAR rallied approximately 100% from its April 2024 low, after bouncing upward above the long-term uptrend line it has been respecting, in the $4.21 price zone.Subsequently, after managing to break above the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from the 2024 high in the $7.17 - $8.00 area, the price action retraced and is currently in a short-term downtrend.It remains to understand how the price will behave in the area of the uptrend line it has been respecting, as it also coincides with the reversal zone drawn from its April low. In the event that the price rejects this line, it would maintain the uptrend and could look for new annual highs with greater probability.Short-Term Price TargetsGiven that NEAR is currently in a downtrend, in order to attempt a long with a higher probability of success, patience will necessarily be required to understand if the price respects the next key downside zone.Such a key zone would be the aforementioned reversal zone drawn from the April low, between $5.84 and $5.11, through which also passes the long-term uptrend line and the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the ATH.-A good entry with a higher confirmation level could be at $6.25, only after the price rejects that zone to the upside and not before. This is important since the fact of rejecting a reversal zone where so many important supports converge increases the probability that the price could go up again.-The second entry with a higher confirmation level would be at $6.73, once the price breaks above the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the last high and the above-mentioned reversal zone.If a long is attempted from this zone, the stop loss should be placed below the reversal zone.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

Its development is structured into five eras: Byron, which established the fundamental architecture and launched the mainnet; Shelley, which decentralized the network through staking pools; Goguen, which integrated smart contracts for decentralized applications (dApps); Basho, currently focusing on scalability and interoperability; and Voltaire, aimed at achieving self-sustainability through decentralized governance systems, including voting and treasury mechanisms, marking the culmination of Cardano's developmental roadmap.Voltaire Era's Strategic ImportanceThe upcoming Chang fork represents a critical milestone as it facilitates the transition to the Voltaire era. Historically, each phase of Cardano's development has introduced significant improvements. The Chang fork will integrate crucial governance mechanisms, including a proposal system for network improvements, a stakeholder voting system, and a treasury system to fund future developments. These enhancements are intended to achieve full decentralization and empower the Cardano community to govern the network autonomously, marking the completion of Cardano\u2019s developmental roadmap.Chang Fork Market EffectsThe Chang fork's introduction of governance features is a pivotal step toward Cardano's goal of self-sustainability. By enabling community-driven proposals and funding through a decentralized treasury, the network aims to foster continuous adaptability. This shift could enhance investor confidence and potentially lead to increased adoption, impacting ADA\u2019s market cap positively. However, the implementation of such systems is complex and may face challenges, including ensuring effective participation and preventing governance attacks. Moreover, the success of the Voltaire era in driving TVL depends on the community's engagement and the effectiveness of the new governance systems. If executed well, these upgrades could make Cardano more attractive to developers and users, boosting the ecosystem\u2019s growth and ADA\u2019s value. On the flip side, if the governance mechanisms fail to operate as intended or encounter significant resistance, it could hamper Cardano's progress and affect its market perception.ADA Performance and ConcernsDespite Cardano\u2019s strong fundamentals, critics argue that its development pace has been slow and its ecosystem less vibrant compared to rivals. Additionally, the price performance of ADA has faced scrutiny, with some investors skeptical about its long-term viability. Another challenge lies in the execution of the proposed governance mechanisms. Effective decentralized governance requires active and informed participation from stakeholders, which can be difficult to achieve. There is also the risk of governance attacks or manipulation by a small group of influential stakeholders, which could undermine the system's integrity."}]}

As Cosmos stands out for its vision of blockchain interoperability aiming to create an \"internet of blockchains\" where different blockchains can communicate and exchange data seamlessly, its price continues to decline potentially visiting the low range. While other assets have experienced notable uptrends, ATOM has struggled to break out of its long-standing consolidation phase, which began during the bear market. The recent sell-off was likely due to the overall negative sentiment in the market following Bitcoin's pullback after attempting to breach the $72,000 mark. Currently, ATOM remains below the bearish trajectory of the Darvas Box.Market Movement Analysis-Market Timing:When a breakout attempt fails to sustain momentum, it often results in the price returning to a ranging movement, potentially revisiting the lower end of the range. ATOM has had several attempts to break out of its two-year range, with the most recent one nearly succeeding as the price sat above all the moving averages. However, another sell-off occurred around April due to the Israel/Iran tension, causing the price to enter the bearish trajectory of the Darvas Box.-Public Interest and Structure:Despite Cosmos' vision of interoperability through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, its price continues to decline. However, developments and partnerships within the Cosmos network, such as Dora Factory launching a gas-free airdrop to over one million ATOM stakes, could boost investor confidence. Once the general market sentiment shifts, ATOM\u2019s current price may be seen as significantly discounted, offering potentially higher rewards for those interested in positioning themselves now.Weekly Technical AnalysisDespite its sideways movement, entering at the right time could yield significant rewards for short-term and midterm investors, potentially reaching gains of roughly 100%. The nearest target is set at the highest point of the range, around $15.69, considering this week\u2019s price action projected to be the lowest of the range.After a five-week decline, ATOM has returned to its consolidation range, indicating the potential for a prolonged waiting period. Currently trading below the middle line of the Darvas Box and with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) below 50, the cryptocurrency faces uncertainty. The wide range between $6.76 and $15.69, which has represented the consolidation zone since the bear market began in 2022, may continue to influence price movements until a clear breakout or catalyst emerges.Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ATOM is still below 50, indicating the potential for a prolonged consolidation phase. If the RSI breaks above 50, it could signal the emergence of a new market structure, eliminating the likelihood of further declines.Daily Technical AnalysisCurrently, Cosmos Hub is positioned for a potential swing high if the recent price action represents the low of the range. A 30% reward is possible if the price bounces near the $7.00 mark and reaches the high of the range at $9.37. It is also noteworthy that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still below 50, with a key resistance level pegged at $8.28. This price coincides with the middle of the Darvas Box, serving as immediate resistance for short-term traders and investors. Nonetheless, in the broader context, Cosmos Hub is considered a sleeper play, with high rewards anticipated for long-term investors.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$7.25 as immediate support, followed by $6.26.-Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $9.37.Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $9.37, the $10.89 price could be the next target.Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $6.26."}]}

Despite Polygon\u2019s acquisition of Toposware, a zero-knowledge cryptography firm valued at around $30-50 million, it continued to decline as the general market experienced a pullback over the past few days. The recent sell-off was attributed to Bitcoin\u2019s price action when it attempted to breach the $72,000 mark but was unsuccessful, causing short-term fear among general market participants.Market Movement Analysis-Capital Rotation and Market Interest:Despite Polygon\u2019s continued development, there is a new player in the blockchain ecosystem which has raised $6 million, surpassing Arbitrum (ARB) and Polygon (MATIC). It would potentially mean that investors and traders would opt to participate in other ecosystems as the market structure provides a context of longer waiting period before ripping the rewards.-Performance:Polygon has suffered a sharp decline of over 50% since the sell-off last March. Anticipating a rebound to the recent highs will require a realistic consolidation period.-Market Cycle:As MATIC is potentially nearing close to the low of the range, an ideal swing high is likely to occur soon. This is backed by Polygon\u2019s launching Community Treasury for blockchain grants worth $720M to fund blockchain projects, targeting developers within the Polygon and Ethereum ecosystems.Weekly Technical AnalysisAfter a five-week decline, MATIC has not yet attempted to break the middle line of the Darvas Box, indicating a potential revisit of the low of its current range. Currently, no significant moves have been recorded despite the release of Polygon\u2019s Community Treasury Grant. Notably, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains below 50, suggesting a potential for a longer consolidation period. A break above 50 in the RSI could signal a new structure, reducing the likelihood of lower lows.Daily Technical AnalysisAn established base was observed during MATIC's consolidation between $0.6534 and $0.7726 over the past 55 days. However, the general market continued to correct since Friday, invalidating the recent low of the range. Currently, the low of the range is pegged at a new price of $0.5822. Today's market has been affected by the CPI news, causing bounces in the majority of coins, including MATIC, which experienced a 5% upward movement. Although further consolidation may occur, it is now expected to take place near the resistance level.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$0.5894 as immediate support, followed by $0.5013-Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $0.7726.Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $0.7726, the $1.00 price could be the next target.Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $0.5822."}]}

The Polkadot Treasury accumulates DOT from various network activities and allocates these funds to initiatives that promise to foster growth and adoption. Over the years, this treasury has played a crucial role in nurturing numerous projects, driving innovation, and enhancing the network's infrastructure.Hydration, previously known as HydraDX, has been an integral part of Polkadot\u2019s DeFi landscape. As a decentralized liquidity protocol, Hydration\u2019s mission has been to provide a flexible and efficient liquidity provisioning system. This project has steadily evolved, contributing to Polkadot's broader vision of a seamless, interconnected blockchain network. The latest funding initiative is a continuation of this historical relationship, aimed at further enhancing liquidity and expanding Polkadot\u2019s DeFi capabilities.Hydration Funding's Strategic ImportanceThe allocation of $14.4 million to Hydration is a significant development in the context of Polkadot's ongoing strategy to bolster its ecosystem. This funding is a clear indication of Polkadot's commitment to enhancing liquidity within its network, which is vital for attracting and retaining users and developers. By consistently funding projects like Hydration, Polkadot not only supports existing DeFi protocols but also signals its dedication to long-term ecosystem development. Providing substantial financial support to Hydration, Polkadot aims to create a more attractive environment for liquidity providers, which is expected to lead to increased participation and network utility. This allocation also reflects Polkadot\u2019s adaptive strategy in responding to the evolving needs of its ecosystem, maintaining its competitive edge in the blockchain industry.Evaluating DOT\u2019s Financial StrategyIncreasing liquidity within the Polkadot ecosystem can enhance the network\u2019s attractiveness, potentially driving up the TVL as more users and assets are drawn to the platform. A higher TVL typically indicates a more vibrant and active DeFi ecosystem, which can, in turn, boost investor confidence and market interest in DOT. However, this positive outlook is not without risks. The success of this initiative hinges on the effective implementation and management of the funds. If the expected liquidity boost and associated rewards fail to materialize, or if the newly attracted liquidity providers do not stay long-term, the anticipated benefits might not be fully realized. Moreover, the broader market conditions and competitive landscape within the DeFi space could impact the outcomes of this funding initiative."}]}

Its breakout above the 52-week high in November 2023 was notable, with the rally extending an additional 50%. However, the subsequent pullback during the Iran/Israel tension and the March market correction led to a significant 50% decline. Yesterday's news might bring enthusiasm to investors as the Polkadot Treasury allocated $14.4 million to the DeFi project Hydration, boosting its liquidity with 2 million DOT. Given the recent macroeconomic developments, Polkadot's move is expected to attract more investors over the next few months in preparation for the 2024 rally.Market Movement Analysis-BTC\u2019s correction:Bitcoin recently experienced a correction when it breached the $72,000 mark last Friday impacting the rest of the market including DOT as it declined over -7%. Despite the downturn, DOT's bullish trend isn't over, with a significant resistance level at approximately $7.90. If this level is surpassed, there could be a substantial rise above $13. leaving this for the optimistic ones in the market.-General Market Interest:Polkadot's substantial investment in Hydration, aimed at enhancing liquidity and efficiency within its ecosystem, could boost both volume and price soon. This announcement, made on June 12, 2024, has the potential to invigorate the market. Given the recent market structure of DOT, a bounce is likely as the price sits near the low of its 60-day range. Notably, Block Diversity, a key investor in the DOT ecosystem, maintains a long-term position in DOT, having bought in at $4.90 and increased exposure at $7.50 and $6.20.Weekly Technical AnalysisOver the last 8 weeks, Polkadot has shown little movement despite operating in a ranging market, with volume consistently remaining below average. Recently affected by the general market correction, DOT\u2019s price has managed to stay above the $6.00 mark, potentially forming its base during this accumulation period. A potential catalyst for DOT is the recently announced Project Hydration, which could spur a surge in buying over the next few days or weeks. Currently, DOT appears primed for another swing high as it holds above the middle line of the Darvas Box.Daily Technical AnalysisDOT's current price is rediscovering support at a historically significant level of around $5.81, despite ongoing difficulties in surpassing the nearest moving averages (MA20 and MA50). DOT has been in a 61-day consolidation period with a 30% range and is presently hovering near the middle line of the Darvas Box. While the price could move lower, the ongoing development of the project presents an opportunity for position traders to take advantage of DOT's discounted price.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$6.091 as immediate support, followed by $5.730-Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $7.5.Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $7.5, the $8.5 price could be the next target.Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $5."}]}

Its deflationary model, combined with the efficient GhostDAG protocol, ensures swift transactions. The recent optimism surrounding Ethereum's most likely final ETF approval, highlights a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. This approval could trigger a broader market rally, benefiting innovative layer 1 solutions like Kaspa.As a proof-of-work cryptocurrency, Kaspa leverages the GHOSTDAG protocol to handle simultaneous transactions, significantly boosting the number of blocks created each second. This makes the platform highly suitable for daily transactions and sets it apart with a commitment to decentralization. The network, which began in November 2021, is community-led, embracing Bitcoin's principles while offering faster, more scalable solutions.Its price performance has been notable, with a 2,000% increase by the end of 2023, driven by its annual halving events and future development plans, including smart contract integration and tokenization.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsThe price of KAS has surged 360% since the October 2023 bull run commenced. Following this significant increase, it experienced a pullback of about 48%, reaching the lower boundary of the $0.1 reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) mapped from the January 2024 low to its all-time high (ATH).However, after rejecting the mentioned reversal zone on the upside, and with the news of the possible approval of the Ethereum ETF on May 20, the price returned to the bullish path, breaking even the reversal zone from the ATH and forming a new all-time high in the $0.194 price zone.After that, the price has pulled back to the lower edge of the reversal zone from the previous ATH in the $0.155 area, to bounce back to the upper zone at $0.171, where it is currently.If this zone between $0.155 - $0.171 is sustained to the upside, price action could look to break the ATH again with a higher probability of occurrence.Short-Term Price TargetsThe ideal entry for KAS, as mentioned in the previous report, was once the reversal zone from the January 2024 low was rejected to the upside and after breaking the 0.23 Fibonacci level at $0.123, and even if there was a pullback below the 0.38 Fibonacci level to $0.13, which was also met before the price started to rise again.At this point in time and given that the ATH was broken a week ago, and that the lower edge of the reversal zone again acted as support for the KAS price, a new entry could be attempted once the price breaks the reversal zone drawn between the ATH and the last low, i.e. at $0.186.At this point the probability of breaking the ATH to the upside would be much higher, but also the stop loss for a long in this area would be high, so proper risk management should be considered in case it is attempted.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

Its BandChain blockchain, built on Cosmos SDK, allows developers to create customized oracle scripts, setting data parameters and validator requirements. Secured by a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) mechanism, BAND token holders can participate as validators or delegators, earning rewards and influencing governance.The ecosystem is expanding with integrations into the Oasis, Aura, and Coreum networks, bridging real-world assets into the Cosmos ecosystem. This growth positions BAND to capitalize on the increasing demand for accurate, decentralized data feeds, especially with the trend towards tokenizing real-world assets like real estate and corporate bonds.Also, its upcoming Band v3 upgrade will enhance transaction speed and reduce costs, essential for scaling to meet rising demands. Features like concurrent price streams and a new signaling hub will provide crucial data feeds for tokenized assets. With a proven security record and strategic upgrades, Band Protocol aims to solidify its dominance in the sector, potentially boosting its token value and market cap.A Dynamic Dive into Market MovementsBAND has surged 195% from its October 2023 low, testing key resistance levels at the 0.61-0.78 Fibonacci zone from its November 2022 high and the 0.38 Fibonacci level from its April 2022 high. These areas have acted as significant barriers, pushing the price down.The rejection brought the price to $1.28, still within the reversal zone defined by the 2024 high ($1.28 - $1.62). Given that this low is higher than the August 2023 low, it indicates that BAND remains in a medium-term uptrend.However, after touching almost exactly the 0.38 Fibonacci level traced from the 2024 high at $1.87, the price plunged back to the reversal zone from the last low, and is currently retesting the uptrend line it has been respecting since the last low.Should it re-test the uptrend line and use it as support, we could see short-term bullish movements in the short term with higher probability.Short-Term Price TargetsGiven that BAND has broken back below the 0.13 Fibonacci level traced from its April 2022 high, it now remains to be seen at what price level it makes a floor to resume its upward path.Such levels could be the current area of $1.35 which has already been support on multiple previous occasions and is the nearest support, the $1.28, where the reversal zone drawn from the last high of August 2023 ends, or the area of the last low between $0.9 and $0.84.In case the price bounces to the upside forming a trap inside the mentioned reversal zone, two entries could be sought:-The first and riskier one at $1.5, but with the confirmation of a continuation of the uptrend.-The second and more confirmatory entry at $1.63, after breaching the 0.23 Fibonacci retracement level from the 2024 high.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

The $2 mark is seen as a strong support level by investors, not only due to its psychological significance but also because of historical consolidation around December 2023. Although no significant volume has been recorded yet, Optimism recently introduced Fault Proofs to its network, marking a key development in its security design. For years, Optimism faced criticism, with claims that its technology was safer and more advanced despite rumors of \"borrowing\" Ethereum\u2019s security apparatus. Now that fault proofs are finally being implemented on Optimism's mainnet, the network's developers, along with the growing ecosystem of teams using its technology, hope to move beyond past criticisms.Market Movement Analysis-100-day Moving Average:By the implementation of Fault Proofs, price could potentially bounce back given certain technical aspects including the strongest moving average commonly used by the general market as the price is nearing the 100-day moving average of the weekly timeframe.-Historical Support:The bounce level of Optimism is closely tied to its historical value, which is near $2.00. This level has proven significant in the past and has been backed by the 100-day moving average of the weekly timeframe.-Relative Strength Index:The relative strength index remains under the middle line. An RSI of 50 is often seen as neutral, meaning the coin has not been either overbought or oversold. However, longer consolidation period can be expected by this context alone.Weekly Technical AnalysisOptimism has continued to correct over the last three weeks, including last week\u2019s sell-off, which was influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s recent breakout attempt above the $72,000 mark. Despite the pullback in OP\u2019s price, the 100-day moving average is approaching, potentially acting as support and aligning with historical price levels. Optimism could revisit and establish its base near the $2.00 mark, with recent price action indicating a range between $3.41 and $1.81. As Optimism's implementation of Fault Proofs gains traction, a potential swing high could be expected, offering a minimum reward of approximately 50%.Daily Technical AnalysisOptimism has attempted to break above its wider consolidation range twice over the last two months. Both attempts were unsuccessful as the general market was cautiously bullish until now. This is due to some short-term holders taking aggressive profits if coins such as OP hits a resistance level causing the price to fall back. Presently, Optimism\u2019s price is under the bearish trajectory of the Darvas Box. However, the projected low of the range is close and position traders can take advantage of the discounted price of OP.Key Inflection Points-Supports:The immediate support for the price is at $2, with the subsequent backing at 1.80.-Resistance:Surpassing the $3.00 mark could drive the price up to $4.Bullish Targets:The nearest target is set at $3, aligning with the resistance of the 100-day moving average.Bearish Targets:If the price falls below $1.80, it could potentially drop to approximately $1.21."}]}

Despite the overall decrease in TVL, Polkadot's decline was notably less severe compared to that of Cosmos.Despite the positive developments within the Cosmos ecosystem, such as the integration of Celestia by Fireblocks to enhance scalability and the large-scale DORA token airdrop aimed at increasing community engagement in decentralized governance, the TVL for Cosmos (ATOM) has seen a decrease.This decline could be attributed to a few factors. Firstly, theintegration with Celestia, while promising for long-term scalability and usability,may not have immediate effects on TVLas it takes time for such integrations to translate into increased platform usage and asset deposits. Secondly, theDORA airdrop, although a significant event, might have led to atemporary liquidity drain as stakers received DORA tokens and potentially reallocated their ATOM holdings to participate in the governanceand quadratic funding rounds.

Despite a significant 60% decline since March 2024, Arbitrum has remained in consolidation over the last nine weeks, with several breakout attempts even after Bitcoin\u2019s correction last week. This stability is potentially supported by the introduction of its BoLD dispute resolution protocol. BoLD, a new protocol, unlocks permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains and enhances their security by mitigating the risk of delay attacks. Currently, Arbitrum is potentially close to the low of its range, hovering near the $0.90 mark, indicating a promising swing setup.Market Movement Analysis-General Market Sentiment:Bitcoin currently experienced a correction following an attempt to break above the $72,000 mark. So, when BTC experiences daily declines ranging from 1% to 5%, it often triggers significant downturns in the ALT coin markets, resulting in prices falling by approximately 20%. Last Friday, ARB experienced an 18% decline in a single day but the day closes at a -8% pullback. This indicates that Bitcoin\u2019s correction causes fear to the general public.-Market Structure:ARB\u2019s current market structure is basically under a larger consolidation period. The price may revisit the all-time low levels which confirms a bounce area at around $0.80 mark. On a broader perspective, no lower-low structure has been recorded since the October 2023 rally. This would not scare investors as they can take huge advantage of the discounted price.Weekly Technical AnalysisArbitrum\u2019s weekly status indicates a potential bounce once the price reaches the demand zone pegged between $0.73 and $0.85. This zone marks the all-time low levels since Arbitrum went public. There was an attempt to enter the bullish trajectory of the range when ARB tried to breach the middle line of the Darvas Box, but this was unsuccessful.

This cautious approach poses challenges for ARB in the coming weeks as it tries to build its structure and establish a safe zone.Daily Technical AnalysisArbitrum's daily RSI level is consolidating between 30 and 40, indicating a prolonged consolidation period. The price is currently below the three key moving averages (MA20, MA50, and MA100), suggesting it may undergo an extended consolidation phase. However, despite these indicators, the introduction of the BoLD dispute resolution protocol to the network, along with future developments, is attracting investors and institutions. This interest could signify a potential shift in momentum for Arbitrum.Key Inflection Points-Supports:The immediate support for the price is at $0.866, with subsequent support at $0.74.-Resistance:Surpassing the $1.1834 mark could drive the price up to $1.4255.Bullish Targets:A realistic target with a shorter holding period is pegged at $1.19.Bearish Targets:If the price falls below the $0.8668 mark, it could potentially push down to around $0.74."}]}

The reaction to the $72,000 mark caused short-term fear in the general market that affected the rest of the cryptocurrencies leaving the majority of the coins at double-digit percentage loss. Presently, BTC failed to gather enough strength to break its all-time high. This is due to the recent macroeconomic reports suggesting a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d sentiment to assets like Bitcoin as the Federal Reserve's decision to hold the current 5.25% to 5.5% interest rate.\u00a0 FED Chair Powell stated loosening the numbers may take longer.Technical Analysis Insights-Bitcoin recently lacked strength during its attempt to break above its all-time high. There were four recorded attempts of the price attempting to break or close near the $70,000 mark but all struggled to sustain its momentum. Currently, Bitcoin is hovering near the 100-day moving average trying to find its potential immediate support as it coincides with a retest of the middle line of the Darvas Box.-Bitcoin is experiencing a price squeeze inside the moving averages. As the moving averages coils, it puts pressure on the price potentially preparing for a spike given the general market interest and strength. This also coincides with the relative strength index breaking above the RSI50 as currently, it hovers near the middle line of the RSI.Potential Weekend Outcomes1. BTC.Dom has finally been out of the 15-day consolidation last week and has just maintained its flat movement since then. BTC.Dom could continue its sluggish movement during the weekends as no potential catalysts are to be expected and the trading volume usually dries down.2. While BTC\u2019s price draws close to the middle line of the Darvas Box and continues to test its immediate support, any catastrophic events could potentially break the line of support. Although it is safe to say that Bitcoin has already been out of the danger zone when it breaches the $60,000 mark, it is important to always stay cautious during weekends.3. A potential scenario to likely happen is Bitcoin to stay flat hovering new the $66,000 - $67,000 range based on BTCDom\u2019s potential price action and given the normal anticipation of trading participants during weekends.Snapshot-Bitcoin is slowly moving back close to the bearish trajectory of the Darvas Box.-BTCDom under a narrow consolidation between $2515 - $2437 over the past 4 days.-BTCDom\u2019s relative strength index has just surpassed RSI 50 and continues its upward movement.Weekend and Monday OutlookBitcoin\u2019s price should hold the $66,000 mark as it is historically significant for the reason that it is the previous breakout zone which is now being retested. If the price holds successfully, another attempt to break out is soon likely to happen.Forecast Flash-If BTCDom breaks above the $2,552 price level, BTC could revisit the $60,000 mark."}]}

It is also a proof-of-work cryptocurrency with a deflationary model, which combined with the GhostDAG protocol ensures fast and simultaneous transactions, significantly increasing the number of blocks created each second. This makes the network ideal for daily transactions while maintaining a strong commitment to decentralisation. Launched in November 2021, Kaspa is a community-led project that embraces Bitcoin's principles but offers faster and more scalable solutions, promising future developments like smart contract integration and tokenization.Kaspa's price performance has been remarkable, with a 2,000% increase by the end of 2023, driven by its annual halving events and promising future developments like smart contract integration and tokenization. This robust growth is further bolstered by the recent optimism surrounding Ethereum's potential final ETF approval, underscoring a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market.Featured Cryptocurrency of the Week: KASThis Week's Breakthroughs:-KAS has had an impressive rise during the first two weeks of June 2024, peaking at a high of over 42% on Wednesday 5 June, and is currently +21% at the time of writing.-This was a week of high volatility for the US market with CPI data, Federal Reserve rates, FOMC conference on Wednesday the 12th and PPI on Thursday.-The US monthly inflation data came in one-tenth below expectations (0.2% vs 0.3% expected), totalling a CPI y/y of 3.3%, and generating a strong bullish effect on the S&P500, the stock market, Bitcoin and the crypto market in the early hours of Wednesday.-The curious thing for Bitcoin was that upon closing a +2.9% 4-hour candle after the IPC announcement, its price rejected the 70k zone downwards, to give back more than 3% on the next 4-hour candle and finishing lower than before the IPC news which had been favourable for the market. This denotes some weakness for Bitcoin in the short term.-In this highly volatile environment and at the close of the week, KAS only had a slight decline of 1.1%, while similar-sized Layer 1 competitors such as NEAR and FTM posted declines of 9% and 7% respectively. In addition, KAS also outperformed Bitcoin, as the latter is currently down 3.7% on the weekly candle.Technical AnalysisRecent Price Movements:-KAS  had a really good start to June, posting a cumulative total rise of around 21%, not counting the almost 13% jump it made during the last 11 days of May, when news of the possible final approval of Ethereum ETFs broke.-On that rise, it reached a new ATH in the $0.194 price zone, marking a new milestone in the history of the Kaspa ecosystem.-It has now retraced that rise towards the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) traced from the previous ATH.-In case it intends to go up again, this reversal zone should be breached, i.e. the price should be back above $0.1715. This would give KAS a much higher probability of breaking back to historical highs towards the $0.207 - $0.215 area possibly.Future Perspectives:-KAS is currently descending towards the reversal zone drawn from its June 1 low of $0.157.-In case the price bounces to the upside in this zone, a new bullish run could be more likely. More importantly, this area is also the lower boundary of the reversal zone drawn from the previous ATH, which would give further validity to the bullish theory if this level acts as support for the price.As explained in this week's report, a new entry could be attempted once the price breaks back above the reversal zone drawn between the ATH and the last low, i.e. $0.186.The probability of revisiting levels near the ATH or even surpassing it would increase if this point is reached.Only an intermediate point at $0.207 will be added, representing the 1.27 Fibonacci level from the ATH and could be a strong resistance point for the price to continue upwards.Weekly Evolution of the Other Cryptocurrencies-Near Protocol (NEAR):NEAR has had a tough week, losing 13.5% of its value after rejecting the downside reversal zone drawn from its 2024 high. It is currently inside the reversal zone from its April low and it remains to be seen if it finally respects the upward trend line it has been following since October 2023.-Fantom (FTM):FTM is also 'inside the reversal zone from its last low, and could reach the $0.575 area, where the reversal zone from its October 2023 low begins. It remains to be seen if this zone will act as support for the price again or if it will be broken to the downside. In case it is respected, the price could have a decent recovery in the short term."}]}

Although the weekly candle has not yet fully closed, with two days remaining, anticipating a sell-off during this market condition may be prudent, suggesting a shift towards a risk-off market. Recent macroeconomic events, including the Federal Reserve's decision to prolong interest rate cuts, have contributed to a bearish market sentiment towards risk assets. Currently, the general market cap is below the 20-day moving average and might potentially retest the $500 billion mark if the sell-off continues and Bitcoin's $65,000 support level fails to hold.Technical Analysis InsightsThe TOTAL3 index continues to pull back after attempting to breach the $700 billion mark. Although the index has reached above this level several times, these gains were unsustained, likely due to the prolonged interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The anticipated catalyst is the launch of the Ethereum ETF, which could positively influence the rest of the altcoins. For now, it is advisable to stay on the sidelines and wait until the market stabilizes before re-entering.Snapshot:-The TOTAL3 index breaks down below the 20-day moving average for the first time since the October 2023 rally marking this as a potential short-term bearish signal.-As Bitcoin continues to retest the $65,000 mark testing its potential immediate support, the rest of the market may experience correction as well potentially revisiting the bear market support.-The relative strength index of TOTAL3 index hovers near the RSI50 indicating a pullback is likely to happen.Weekend and Monday OutlookDespite the low volatility and reduced market participation typically seen on weekends, a sudden spike in fear can prompt participants to sell hastily, as fear tends to outweigh greed. However, this environment presents an opportunity for savvy investors to begin accumulating assets, as some coins are currently trading at considerably low prices.Forecast Flash:-As Bitcoin acts as the main driver of the general market, if the $65,000 mark fails to hold, a bloodbath to the entire market may occur."}]}

Another breakout attempt occurred in the last week of March but also failed, likely due to market fears stemming from the Iran/Israel tensions, which led to a market-wide downturn. Presently, following Bitcoin\u2019s sell-off last week, Quant's price action has resulted in a continuous decline, hovering near the consolidation levels seen during the previous bear market.Market Movement Analysis-Capital Rotation:While QNT offers some advantages of its technology, a new player comes into the picture. Blockdag\u2019s $48.8 Million presale of Keynote 2 ignites a market surge leaving QNT outside the picture.-Market Cycle:As QUANT attempted to establish a new structure by breaking out of the bear market consolidation, its price unfortunately fell back to the lower levels and recently tried to establish an immediate support after last week\u2019s selloff. This suggests that future market participants may need to be prepared for a longer holding period as the price sits back to the low of the range of the bear market\u00a0 season.-Moving Averages:With all the moving averages still in inverted positions (MA20 below MA50 and MA50 below MA100), the price's attempt to recover and close the gap with the nearest 20-day moving average may indicate the start of a reversal.Weekly TechnicalAnalysisDuring the rally from October 2023 to March 2024, QNT's price failed to sustain higher levels, preventing the formation of a solid structure on the weekly timeframe. Now, the price has breached the demand zone, nearing the $80 mark. However, it is currently exploring its immediate support, presenting a discounted price and a promising opportunity for short-term and mid-term investors once the general market shifts.Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for QNT remains below 50 and is trending towards 30, indicating the potential for a prolonged consolidation period or even a continued price pullback. A break above 50 in the RSI could signal the formation of a new structure, reducing the likelihood of lower lows. The RSI 50 level is pegged at $103, which coincides with a price level where QNT might encounter resistance from the moving averages.Daily TechnicalAnalysisQuant (QNT) recently experienced a fakeout during last week's sell-off, causing some investors to be shaken out. The price has not yet fully recovered, continuing to hover near the lower-low range. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily timeframe also indicates a bearish sentiment, remaining flat around the RSI 30 level. This suggests a longer consolidation period is likely. However, once QNT establishes strong support and breaks the current market structure, general market participants may take advantage of the discounted price before the next crypto bull run begins.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$80 as immediate support, followed by $50-Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $95.Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $95, the $105 price could be the next target.Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $50."}]}

Its integration with the Transporter cross-chain bridge underscores its pivotal role in cross-chain token transfers and connecting real-world data to blockchain. Highlighting its significance, co-founder Sergey Nazarov emphasised the importance of decentralised oracle networks in preventing vulnerabilities seen in traditional financial systems, showcasing their potential to enhance reliability and transparency. Expanding partnerships, such as those with Aptos and DTCC for decentralised app development and fund tokenization, further illustrate its commitment to innovation and influential presence in the blockchain ecosystem.Chainlink's technological advancements and strategic partnerships are also driving LINK\u2019s bullish momentum. The recent collaboration with Swift Payments, announced at the Consensus Conference, has injected optimism into the community and reinforced its role in secure data transmission for smart contracts. Reflecting its growth, the ecosystem has seen a 40% price surge in the past month, bolstering its market valuation to $10.8 billion.Featured Cryptocurrency of the Week: LINKThis Week's Breakthroughs:-Despite being the best-performing altcoin in our selection of the Oracles category this week, at the time of writing this report it has a cumulative -7.3% on the weekly candle.-Earlier in the week, it was also announced that Chainlink's CCIP and Automation protocols are now live on Gnosis, reducing gas fees by up to 90% and enabling inter-blockchain communication. This integration allows Gnosis developers to outsource heavy computational tasks, fostering powerful real-world applications.-LINK also rode the bullish wave momentarily driven by the CPI report on Wednesday, June 12, scoring +6.79% during the day, only to fall the following two days to reach the same starting point prior to the CPI report.Technical AnalysisRecent Price Movements:LINK has rejected to the downside the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) drawn from its last high, which starts at $18.65.In addition, it is currently inside the reversal zone from its last low and high between $15.29 - $14.25, and reaching the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high (at $14.4).Should the above reversal zone and 0.23 Fibonacci level be rejected to the upside, i.e. used as support, the chances of seeing further upward momentum would increase considerably, as a higher low would also have formed, and with it a continuation of the uptrend.Future Perspectives:In case LINK finally bounces back to the $14.25 - $14.4 area or respects it with a candlestick close, it could increase the upside probability and look for a long at a later date.Given that the $15.29 level has been broken to the downside, a bounce could be sought at the following key levels, using the following two entries as parameters:-The first at $15.55 once price rejects the upside reversal zone from the last low and breaks above the 0.13 Fibonacci level from the last high.-The second is at $16.55 as expressed in the LINK weekly report, after breaking the 0.38 level from the last high and the last relative highs.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesBand Protocol (BAND):-BAND has had a weekly decline of almost 13% at the time of this writing, which takes it to the lower end of the reversal zone from its last low.-In case it breaks below this zone, it could visit $1.1 or even close to its ATL at $0.9.API3 (API3):-API3 has had a drop of approximately 27% this week, after using as resistance the price zone near $3.76 which is where the reversal zone from its 2024 high begins.-It is currently approaching the $2.41 price zone, which is where the reversal zone traced from August 2023 begins.

The Web3 Foundation, which oversees Polkadot's development, has consistently focused on advancing decentralized web technologies. A significant milestone in Polkadot's journey is the upcoming Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) upgrade. This upgrade seeks to improve data management and interoperability within the network, promising a more versatile environment for Layer 2 scalability without the need for roll-up solutions.Boosting Network Resilience GoalsThe announcement of a $65 million DOT prize pool by the Web3 Foundation to support the JAM upgrade is a noteworthy development. Historically, Polkadot has relied on community governance to ratify upgrades, ensuring that changes are aligned with the ecosystem's collective vision. This prize pool incentivizes the development of JAM implementations in various programming languages, a move that underscores the Foundation's commitment to fostering a robust and adaptable network. By linking the prize to achieving specific milestones, such as performance standards on Kusama and Polkadot and passing security audits, the Foundation aims to ensure that the upgrade is executed to the highest standards.Assessing DOT's Growth PotentialBy enhancing data management and interoperability, JAM can increase Polkadot's appeal to developers and users, potentially boosting its TVL and market capitalization. However, the success of this initiative hinges on the timely and effective implementation of the upgrade. The $65 million prize pool, while substantial, may also raise questions about the sustainability of such incentives and whether they can lead to long-term growth or merely short-term gains."}]}

This decline comes after an impressive run-up since October 2023, where NEAR surged about 800% from a low of $0.967. Despite the downturn, some analysts remain optimistic, projecting a potential rise to $9 by the second quarter of 2024. This optimism is fueled by NEAR Protocol\u2019s scalable blockchain infrastructure, which supports a wide array of decentralized applications (dApps). Currently, NEAR is poised to drop close to the $4.00 mark or potentially build its base around the $4.50 level.Current market sentiment?Bitcoin is currently retesting the $65,000 mark following its recent attempt to break above $72,000. As Bitcoin corrects and continues to retest this support zone, the rest of the market has suffered double-digit losses over the last two consecutive days.Why are investors shifting?NEAR investors are potentially shifting to BlockDAG as its presale surges to $51.1 million amidst rising Arbitrum prices. In this market scenario, BlockDAG, a Layer 1 initiative, has emerged as a top investment choice. Investors are temporarily moving their funds to newer coins in the market.Implications for NEAR?Following a four-week downturn, NEAR is discovering new support zones and may potentially build its base once the market stabilizes. The weekly timeframe confirms a healthy correction after a parabolic move in the first quarter of 2024. NEAR is currently challenging the structural low or the high-low structure, which is considered a danger zone for short-term holders. However, for those on the sidelines, this could be a significant opportunity due to the discounted price.Technical indicators?NEAR's Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the weekly timeframe has dropped below 50 for the first time since October 2023. This should not cause fear, as it could react to the mid-level of RSI, causing the price to bounce in line with historical support levels.Daily analysis outcome?NEAR\u2019s recent attempt to break above $9.00 was unsustained due to several market factors, including the FED's delay in cutting interest rates and Bitcoin's rejection at $72,000. NEAR is revisiting the lows of the April 2024 sell-off, a significant zone that previously acted as a breakout point and may now serve as support. As the price settles and forms a base, it could mark the start of an accumulation phase. In addition, the NEAR RSI is near oversold levels. If the broader market detects these conditions and acts accordingly, a trend reversal is likely to occur soon.Key support/resistance levels?-Supports:The immediate support for the price is at $4.30, with subsequent support at $3.00.-Resistance:Surpassing the $6.00 mark could drive the price up to $8.87.Bullish/bearish targets?-Bullish Targets:As the coin hasn\u2019t created its base yet, the nearest target is pegged at $6.00.-Bearish Targets:The $4.50 level should hold; otherwise, the coin may drop to the $3.00 mark."}]}

The ecosystem's initial foray into gaming was marked by partnerships and projects like Star Atlas and Aurory, which showcased the potential of blockchain-based gaming on Solana. These early projects leveraged Solana's speed and scalability to provide smooth, immersive gaming experiences, setting a precedent for future developments. Despite these promising beginnings, the ecosystem faced challenges, including network outages and the struggle to build a robust developer community, which hindered its ability to fully capitalize on its technical advantages.Sonic Funding Boosts SolanaThe recent $12 million Series A funding raised by Sonic, a gaming-focused layer-2 blockchain on Solana, marks a significant milestone in the evolution of Solana\u2019s gaming ecosystem. This funding, led by prominent investors such as Bitkraft, Galaxy Interactive, and Big Brain Holdings, underscores a growing confidence in Solana's potential within the gaming industry. The emphasis on developing game execution tools and a sandbox environment aligns with the historical context of Solana's strategic focus on gaming. This initiative aims to address previous limitations by enhancing developer tools and infrastructure, thus facilitating the creation of more sophisticated and engaging gaming experiences on the platform.Gaming Investment Influences SOLBy providing a more robust framework for game development, Sonic is likely to attract more developers and gaming projects to Solana. This influx could increase network activity and drive up demand for SOL tokens, thereby boosting its market cap. However, it's essential to approach this optimism with caution. The gaming sector is highly competitive, and Solana's network still faces potential technical and security challenges. Moreover, the broader cryptocurrency market's volatility could also impact the realized benefits of this development.Solana's Edge in GamingSolana\u2019s proactive approach in nurturing a specialized layer-2 solution for gaming, such as Sonic, highlights its strategic differentiation from competitors like Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX). While ADA and AVAX have made significant strides in DeFi and enterprise solutions, Solana\u2019s targeted investment in the gaming sector positions it uniquely. Sonic\u2019s promise of the fastest on-chain gaming experience, combined with customizable gaming primitives and extensible data types, offers a compelling proposition for game developers. However, it\u2019s crucial to note that this strategy's success will depend on its execution and ability to maintain network stability, a lesson from Solana\u2019s past network disruptions. If Sonic succeeds, it could establish Solana as the go-to blockchain for gaming, but the road ahead requires careful navigation of technical and market challenges."}]}

This drop is likely linked to Bitcoin's recent decline below $65,000, which has set the stage for a broader bearish trend.Why Are Long-Term Holders Optimistic?The overall market sentiment is bearish. Bitcoin's fall has influenced the entire market, including ADA. Despite this, some long-term holders remain optimistic about ADA's future, especially with the potential approval of an ADA spot ETF following the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs in the U.S.How Is Cardano Developing?While Cardano is trying to establish its base after a significant market correction, its development team continues to work on key projects like Ouroboros Leios, Genesis, UTXO-HD, and LSM. These projects aim to prepare the network for mainstream adoption and could signal a shift in momentum.What's the Current Market Performance?ADA has seen a significant decline of over 50% since the March sell-off. A consolidation period is necessary to stabilize the price and rebuild investor confidence before anticipating a rebound.Currently, all moving averages are inverted, with MA20 below MA50 and MA50 below MA100. The recent price movement trying to close the gap with MA20 suggests a possible reversal. However, the price falling below the 100-day moving average this week indicates further challenges ahead in shifting momentum.Technical Indicators?After an extended period of consolidation, Cardano's price structure has dropped and might revisit the demand zone seen during the 2022 bear market, around the $0.27 level. This is influenced by the broader market sentiment, as Bitcoin continues to decline.As the price drops, the relative strength index (RSI) is also nearing oversold levels between $0.24 and $0.28. Currently, the price could fall further towards the projected demand zone at $0.2794, which aligns with the RSI30 level.What happened in the daily analysis?ADA\u2019s price action on the daily timeframe confirms a bearish trend, with the price dropping below the Darvas Box and the RSI falling below 30. For some traders and investors, an RSI below 30 signals an oversold level, offering a chance to buy at a lower price. However, others might wait for a more stable market structure to avoid further decline.A shift in overall market sentiment, currently in a short-term downtrend, will likely be the catalyst for ADA\u2019s momentum change. Once the market stabilizes, ADA's accumulation stage could commence.Key support and resistance levels?-Supports:Immediate support at $0.30, followed by $0.24.-Resistance:The next resistance to break is above $0.51.Bullish/Bearish Targets?-Bullish Targets:If the price breaks above $0.51, the next target could be $0.68.-Bearish Targets:The realistic bearish target is set at $0.28."}]}

FTM experienced a remarkable 400% surge since the October 2023 rally, with 300% of that growth occurring within six weeks following the approval of the BTC-ETF, driven by highly bullish market sentiment. This parabolic rally saw the price skyrocket from $0.42 to $1.22. However, FTM faced a 50% pullback as the broader market corrected at the end of the first quarter of this year.Despite speculation that FTM has entered an opportunity zone for accumulation, the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio indicates that bearish forces are still influencing the token's direction. A sudden spike in the NVT Ratio on June 17 suggests the cryptocurrency is overvalued compared to circulating tokens on the blockchain. This contributes to a more bearish sentiment among FTM holders as they await the upcoming Sonic upgrade event.What should we watch for?-Market Sentiment:As Ethereum anticipates a potential rally following the approval of the ETF product, its price may have already factored in this event when it surged from $3,000 to nearly $4,000. However, this spike was short-lived and unsustained, affecting the broader ecosystem, including Fantom (FTM). Since mid-May 2024, FTM has experienced a 50% decline, mirroring the broader market's volatility.-Sonic Upgrade:Recently, there has been low development activity on the Fantom network since June 14, indicating a decreased commitment from developers to improve the network. However, the upcoming Sonic upgrade, projected for Q3, could potentially save FTM from further losses. The market is eagerly awaiting the announcement of the Mainnet event date for the Sonic upgrade. If a date is set, buying pressure may increase, potentially pushing FTM back to $1.What Do the Charts Say? Weekly AnalysisFantom (FTM) has experienced a five-week consecutive decline, even breaching the projected range support on the weekly timeframe. However, as the trading week progresses, a wick is starting to form, indicating a push from the bears when the price dipped below the $0.50 mark. If this week\u2019s candle closes above $0.50, the previous resistance will have been retested and will now be considered the immediate support.Historically, Fantom (FTM) tends to trail the 50-day moving average on the weekly timeframe, indicating it as a key indicator for its price movements. The chart shows price consolidations around this moving average last November 2023 and earlier this year. Currently, a bounce off the 50-day moving average is materializing, with the price continuing to recover and build its base above this crucial level.Daily Analysis: Is the decline ending?This week\u2019s price action may signal the end of Fantom\u2019s (FTM) downtrend, as the price attempts to stabilize above the $0.50 mark. While this could mark the end of the five-week decline, consolidation is expected and should be established over the next few weeks to confirm the accumulation stage. Notably, the relative strength index (RSI) has bounced off from oversold levels and remains above RSI30, suggesting a potential end to the sell-off.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$0.50 is the immediate support level, with $0.325 following closely behind.-Resistance:$0.90 is the next immediate resistance considering this is a whole number resistance, followed by $1.14Targets-Bullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period, is set at $0.80.-Bearish Targets:A break below $0.50 could potentially lead the price back to the Demand Zone support pegged at $0.35."}]}

This uptick may suggest traders are anticipating a bullish recovery as SOL seeks immediate support around the significant historical value of $135, touching its previous breakout zone. Additionally, Solana's derivatives trading volume has surged by over 60% to $3.77 billion, indicating increased investor interest. However, SOL's open interest has slightly declined by 0.20% to $2.05 billion, suggesting fewer long-term positions and a possible negative sentiment. Despite this, the Money Flow Index (MFI) rating of 58.01 points to the continuation of the bull market with increasing buying pressure.What\u2019s influencing Solana\u2019s movement?-General Market Interest:Bitcoin continues to retest its middle level within the wider range of $73,800 - $56,500. Following Bitcoin\u2019s recent correction from $72,000, SOL has experienced a 30% pullback since May, reaching its lowest level in the past 30 days. Overall, the market lacks a solid upward direction and may potentially move sideways over the next few weeks or months.-Solana X Paypal:Solana (SOL) experienced an 8.52% upswing, surpassing the $150 mark due to the integration of PayPal\u2019s PYUSD stablecoin into Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem. Its price recovered from a 30-day bottom of $139, briefly touching $151, marking the end of a nearly 25-day decline. Data from Coinglass reveals a strong short-term bullish sentiment with $108.37 million in long positions compared to $82 million in short positions. The integration of PYUSD into the Solana and Injective blockchains was designed to leverage Solana's high-speed, low-cost transaction capabilities, thereby enhancing the usability of PYUSD for everyday transactions and expanding its reach within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.What does the weekly chart show?Solana (SOL) has shown declines over the past five weeks, aligning with the broader market sentiment where many cryptocurrencies are experiencing price corrections. Interestingly, SOL\u2019s price action, when viewed over a longer period, forms a classic cup and handle pattern. The current price correction is acting as the support level, indicating that SOL could be poised for its next leg up, potentially breaching higher prices and even making a new all-time high. Although the relative strength index (RSI) is pointing lower, it has not breached below the middle line. A bounce is likely once it touches the RSI50, coinciding with the price establishing its immediate support.What\u2019s happening daily?Solana (SOL) is currently in a phase of healthy consolidation on its daily timeframe, maintaining above the low of the range established over the past 47 days despite recent sell-offs. There is anticipation that the price may revisit the $120 mark, which represents the low of this consolidation range, given the ongoing instability in the general market. Once a reaction is observed at the $120 support level, it could attract short-term investors looking to capitalize on a potential 80% reward from a swing high setup.Inflection Points-Supports:$116.98 as immediate support, followed by $84-Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $165.Targets-Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $165, the $200 price could be the next target.-Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $116."}]}

Since June, miners have sold approximately 30,000 BTC, valued at around $2 billion, marking their highest sales volume in over a year. The breakdown of the $65,000 level has caused short-term fear due to its psychological and technical significance.Why Are Miners Selling?Bitcoin miners have sold a large volume of BTC, impacting its price and potentially leading to a second consecutive negative monthly close. This sluggish performance is due to significant selling by Bitcoin miners and recent outflows from spot ETFs. Currently, Bitcoin\u2019s price is at its immediate support and may retest the psychological support level pegged at $60,000.Weekly Analysis: What\u2019s the Technical Stance?Bitcoin\u2019s technical market structure has weakened following its failed breakout attempt at the $72,000 mark. This recent attempt, the fifth of its kind, was unsustained, leading to a slow and steady decline in price from $72,000 to $61,000.

This decline coincides with news about repayments related to the Mt. Gox Bitcoin hacking incident of 2014, which might add selling pressure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum markets.Why Are Repayments Impactful?The Mt. Gox repayments, starting in July 2024, will be made in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. This could add selling pressure to the markets as early investors might sell their received assets. Ethereum\u2019s performance hasn't shown significant strength recently, especially after the SEC approved its SPOT ETF product, indicating a temporary loss of investor confidence.Weekly Analysis: What\u2019s the Technical Stance?Ethereum\u2019s weekly price action shows several support confluences, including the 20-day moving average and the Fibonacci 50 of a bullish engulfing candle. The previous multi-year high breakout zone is turning into support. A bullish engulfing candle confirms that the $3,047 level may see a potential bounce, coinciding with the historical and psychological support at $3,000.What Should You Expect?Ethereum\u2019s price might bounce as the relative strength index (RSI) hovers close to the middle line (RSI50). This often leads to consolidation and potential breakout, signaling a shift in momentum. Watching the RSI movement is crucial for anticipating this trend.Daily Analysis: What Are the Short-Term Indicators?Ethereum shows short-term bearish sentiment, dropping below the middle line of its larger range and entering the bearish trajectory of the Darvas Box. Also, the current candle breaks below the 100-day moving average, which is considered a key trend indicator by retail traders. The average closing price over the last 100 trading days is now below $3,400, reinforcing the bearish outlook. Nonetheless, this should not deter future investors and those who have stayed on the sidelines from taking advantage of the market dip.What Are the Key Levels?-Supports:Immediate support at $3,000, followed by $2,800.-Resistance:Ethereum needs to break above $3,500 to confirm a bullish structure.What Are the Bullish and Bearish Targets?-Bullish Target:The nearest target is $3,500.-Bearish Target:A break below $3,000 could lead to $2,800. While this is not likely soon, staying alert to market sentiment is wise."}]}

The projected low of the range has been retested for the third time and could now act as immediate support as the price continues to build momentum, despite a market correction yesterday slowly. This week's price action could close on a positive note after four consecutive weeks of negative closing.Why the Market Correction?-General Market Sentiment:The general market experienced price corrections when Bitcoin\u2019s significant support failed to hold as the price dropped below the $65,000 mark. The drop caused the general market\u2019s fear as the \u201cfear and greed index\u201d hit the \u201cfear zone\u201d for the first time since the last 18 months.\u00a0 All other ecosystems were affected by Bitcoin\u2019s move.What\u2019s the Impact of Mt. Gox Repayments?-Mount Gox Bitcoin Repayment:The repayments will begin in July 2024 and will be made in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, potentially adding selling pressure to both markets. These repayments are expected to significantly impact Bitcoin (BTC) markets, as early investors, receiving assets at much higher values than their pre-2013 entries, may be inclined to sell at least part of their holdings.Weekly Analysis: Is NEAR Recovering?Following a four-week downturn, NEAR finally has the chance to close this week with a positive candle as the general market strives to build bases. Last week, the relative strength index (RSI) bounce projection materialized, with the price rebounding from the flip zone\u2014a previous resistance turned support\u2014coinciding with an RSI50 bounce. This recent price action confirms a retest of the lower range while the price slowly trends upward.Daily Analysis: What Are the Short-Term Indicators?NEAR\u2019s daily timeframe is more intriguing as the price may have established a higher low structure, staying above the $5.00 mark for the last 5 days, indicating immediate support for short-term holders potentially trading the swing low. The arrows in the screenshot above illustrate both bullish and bearish scenarios. A bullish scenario unfolds if the price successfully breaches the $6.00 mark, including a retest. Conversely, a bearish scenario occurs if the $4.72 price level fails to hold, potentially leading to another sell-off and causing the price to drop near the $3.00 mark.What Are the Key Levels?-Supports:The immediate price support is $4.72, with subsequent support at $3.-Resistance:Surpassing the $6 mark could drive the price up to $8.87.What Are the Bullish and Bearish Targets?-Bullish Targets:The coin has potentially discovered its base but it hasn\u2019t retested it yet. If a retest follows over the next few days, the $7.00 mark can be tagged as the nearest target for the bulls.-Bearish Targets:For an overall bearish sentiment of the general market, NEAR can drop to as low as $3.00."}]}

ADA\u2019s volatility remained low, recording roughly a 4% change compared to the two major coins. This volatility was driven by rumours about the Mount Gox Bitcoin hacking incident, which suggested that repayments to victims would begin in July 2024 and be made in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, potentially adding selling pressure to both markets. Despite this market scenario, ADA consistently hovered above the $0.35 price level, marking its immediate support as it tries to build and consolidate a base.What Are the Key Developments?-Cardano unveils an upgrade enhancing their staking accessibility, \u201cdocker-cardano-cli v8.24.0.0-1\u201d. This continual enhancement aiming at improving stake pool operations and user access to staking functions upholds Cardano's reputation as a leading blockchain network, underlined by its robust GitHub activity.-While Cardano is still in the process of establishing its base following a bloody market correction, its development team continues to work on Ouroboros Leios, Ouroboros Genesis, UTXO-HD, and LSM, preparing the network for mainstream adoption. As these developments materialize the soonest, it could signify the beginning of a shift in momentum for the cryptocurrency.How Is ADA Performing?-Despite its project developments, ADA's market performance has been subdued, with a 17.44% decrease in trading volume and a price hovering around $0.3871. Sustained developmental progress and increased attention from whales may be necessary to catalyze a recovery in ADA\u2019s valuation, especially if broader market conditions stabilize.Weekly Analysis: What to Expect?Following a volatile move in Bitcoin and Ethereum, ADA remains above the $0.35 mark, historically significant due to the consolidation range between $0.30 and $0.40. Currently, Cardano is below the 100-day moving average on the weekly timeframe, presenting a significant challenge for short-term holders as it acts as resistance. Additionally, the demand zone suggests the coin may have more room to decline, with a potential 40% downside before hitting key levels around $0.20. However, a bullish scenario is also possible as ADA continues to build its base. Once it establishes this base and achieves a solid breakout, it could trigger a shift in momentum.Daily Analysis: What Are the Short-Term Indicators?ADA\u2019s daily structure may not be as enticing compared to other cryptocurrencies, as it has closed at nearly the same price over the last 8 days. Both bullish and bearish scenarios are possible. However, with the general market sentiment slightly fearful due to Bitcoin approaching a danger zone, it may be best to stay on the sidelines and wait for the perfect timing. Additionally, ADA\u2019s relative strength index hovers close to oversold levels, indicating a potential longer consolidation period.What Are the Key Levels?-Supports:$0.35 as immediate support, followed by $0.30-Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $0.40.What Are the Bullish and Bearish Targets?-Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $0.51, the $0.68 price could be the next target.-Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $0.24."}]}

This was achieved through its unique architecture, which includes the Relay Chain, the core network that provides shared security and consensus, and parachains, which are individual blockchains that run in parallel. One of the key challenges Polkadot has faced is increasing the throughput of these parachains without compromising security. Traditional methods of scaling, such as increasing block size or reducing block time, often lead to centralization risks and decreased network security. Elastic Scaling has emerged as a potential solution to this problem. By allowing parachains to produce multiple blocks for each Relay Chain block, which are then validated in parallel, Polkadot aims to enhance throughput efficiently. This is akin to multi-core processing in computers, where multiple tasks are executed simultaneously.Scalability Solution for DOTHistorically, Polkadot has sought to balance scalability, security, and decentralization. Elastic Scaling directly addresses this triad by allowing for greater throughput without the typical trade-offs. The new model introduces Agile Coretime, which departs from the traditional auction system where projects bid for long-term parachain slots. Instead, projects can purchase coretime for shorter durations based on their specific needs. This flexible approach means that projects can scale their operations up or down based on demand, thereby optimizing their performance and cost-efficiency. By providing a mechanism for more dynamic and efficient resource allocation, Elastic Scaling not only enhances the scalability of the network but also makes it more adaptable to the varying needs of different projects.Elastic Scaling Economic EffectsThe implementation of Elastic Scaling could have significant implications for Polkadot's native token, DOT. Enhanced scalability and cost-efficiency are likely to attract more projects to the Polkadot ecosystem, potentially increasing the network\u2019s TVL. A higher TVL indicates greater utility and adoption of the network, which can positively influence DOT\u2019s market cap.Competitive Edge ExplainedPolkadot's Elastic Scaling model sets it apart from competitors like Cosmos (ATOM) and Quant (QNT) by integrating scalability directly into its core architecture. While Cosmos focuses on interoperability and relies on individual blockchains to manage their own scaling solutions, and Quant connects networks at the application level without addressing intra-chain scalability, Polkadot offers a more cohesive approach. The combination of built-in scalability and adaptability positions Polkadot as a versatile and efficient platform, although its success will depend on the effective management of these advanced features and the ecosystem's response."}]}

Last week\u2019s price action confirmed a strong closing as the price held above $0.51, forming a reversal candle and closing above the support of the 3-month range. This recent rise has recorded a 10.7% move in the last three days, with FTM currently trading near the $0.57 mark. The rise outperforms the broader crypto market, with FTM's daily trading volume reaching $180 million and a market capitalization of $1.63 billion.What should we watch for?-Sonic Labs Partnership:The Fantom Foundation has partnered with Sonic Labs to launch the Sonic Labs Innovator Fund, contributing up to 200 million FTM to expedite the integration of partners and dApps into the Sonic network. This funding will provide assistance to current Fantom projects and innovative applications native to the new Sonic network through investments in top-tier infrastructure providers and on-chain tools. This development will entice the participants and should sustain the recovery while it has just started.What Do the Charts Say? Weekly AnalysisFantom (FTM) has now entered a stage favorable for mid-term holders as the price touches the 50-day moving average for the first time this year. This marks the start of a longer consolidation period, indicating that the price may have established its base. The price movement is expected to swing from the low to the middle of the range, presenting challenges in breaching the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box. The next phase should involve consolidation in the middle of the range, potentially leading to a short-term rally to the top of the range. While this does not guarantee a smooth run, the potential rewards are high compared to the risks.Daily Analysis: Is the decline ending?An ascending channel line has been spotted in the daily timeframe, with the price respecting its movement over the past two weeks. The recent declines were caused by two factors: resistance from the 20-day moving average and the top channel line. Currently, FTM is at a critical juncture, presenting two potential scenarios.In the first scenario, the price successfully breaches the channel line, confirming a higher-low structure and a break of market structure. In the second scenario, the price fails to hold above the $0.50 mark, breaches the channel line, and potentially drops to the $0.36 level.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$0.55 is the immediate support level, with $0.50 following closely behind.-Resistance:$0.65 is the next immediate resistance considering this is a whole number resistance, followed by $0.90Targets-Bullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period, is set at $0.90.-Bearish Targets:Fantom's market dynamics suggest a possible challenge to the $0.36 support level if selling pressure persists."}]}

Should it break the $5.37 price zone, there could be further declines towards the next supports such as $4.23 and $3.6.It is also worth noting that Bitcoin has also been showing weakness over the past few weeks, after rejecting the downside reversal zone drawn from the ATH.What Are the Short-Term Price Targets?In case DOT price continues below the uptrend line, the price could head towards the end of the reversal zone drawn from the October 2023 low at $5.37, and then to levels like $5.13 - $4.4 and to the last historical supports like $4.23 - $3.6 (see purple labels in the image).For the scenario where DOT returns to the upward path, it should recover at least the $6.54 area, where the 0.13 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high is located. In this case, there could be two entries at the moment:-First Entry:At $6.8, a riskier level with lower confirmation after rejecting the reversal zone from the October 2023 low, breaching the 0.13 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high, and riding again on the uptrend line.-Second Entry: At $7.35, with higher confirmation after breaking the 0.23 Fibonacci level and the last relative highs.Acquisition Goals Chart"}]}

Goxcreates a situation where asubstantial amount of BTC may enter the market. Thefear of this potential increase in supply, coupled with the historical baggage associated with Mt. Gox, leads tonegative sentimentand preemptive selling by investors. This chain reaction ultimately putsdownward pressureon BTC's price.What About Near and Kaspa?On one hand, theNear Protocolis currently experiencing amixed situation. On the negative side, the protocol has seen asignificant decline in network activity, with daily transaction volumes, unique on-chain interactions, and active addresses all dropping sharply over the past month, leading to adecrease in network fees, revenue, and a double-digit decline in the value of its native token, NEAR. However, there arepositive developmentson the horizon, including asubstantial $350 million funding roundled by Tiger Global toexpand NEAR's global presence, and astrategic partnership with Frax Financeto enhance its multi-chain capabilities and introduce innovative DeFi solutions. These initiatives are expected to bolster NEAR's ecosystem and drive future growth, counteracting the recent downturn in network activity.On the other hand,Kaspa has experienced nearly 20% growthin its price primarily due to the significantendorsement and adoption by Marathon Digital, a leading Bitcoin miner. Marathon Digital's decision to diversify its revenue streams by mining Kaspa, highlighted by the deployment of their first Kaspa mining machine in September 2023 and thesuccessful mining of 93 million KAS tokens, has bolsteredinvestor confidencein Kaspa's future prospects. The company's choice was driven by Kaspa'sfair launch, advanced technology, growing ecosystem, and high profitability, all of which position Kaspa as an attractive and efficient mining option. This strategic move, combined with the rapid transaction speed of the Kaspa network, has significantly increased market interest and demand, driving the price surge.What's driving Fantom's price increase?Last but not least,Fantom has seen an increase in its price following the announcement by the Fantom Foundation of a substantial financial commitment to support the launch of Sonic, a new ultra-fast network. The foundation is dedicating up to200 million Fantom tokens, worth approximately $120 million, to the Sonic Labs Innovator Fund, aimed at attracting developers and companies to the Sonic network. This initiative focuses on providingstrategic grants to existing applicationswithin the Fantom ecosystem, particularly those keen on leveraging Sonic technology. The significant investment and strategicfocus on enhancing network capabilities and expanding the ecosystem have positively influenced investor sentiment, contributing to the recent price surge of Fantom's native token."}]}

However, AVAX has recently experienced a five-week consecutive decline, with the price dropping from $41.77 to $24.13. This decline is attributed to the broader market sentiment as Bitcoin corrected its price after failing to sustain an attempt to break above the $72,000 mark, along with the recent Mount Gox Bitcoin repayments from the hacking incident.New Service: ResellaDespite Avalanche's pullback, the project has announced a new service called Resella, which aims to facilitate the creation, issuance, and trading of NFTs. This service is designed to enhance the accessibility of blockchain technology, especially for newcomers to the digital landscape. By supporting transactions in Japanese yen, Resella caters to the specific needs of the Japanese market while also laying the groundwork for global expansion. This service, brought to you by Konami Digital Entertainment, seeks to merge traditional gaming with advanced blockchain technology, improving the accessibility and user-friendliness of NFTs.Market Sentiment and Movements-\tOverall Market Sentiment:The entire market has experienced a correction over the past two weeks, including this week\u2019s opening, as news about the Mount Gox Bitcoin repayments spread, causing a crash in BTC. The repayments, set to begin in July 2024, will be made in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, potentially adding selling pressure to both markets. These repayments are expected to significantly impact Bitcoin (BTC) markets, as early investors, who will receive assets at much higher values than their pre-2013 entries, may be inclined to sell at least part of their holdings.-\tMarket Cycle:After a remarkable 600% surge since the October 2023 rally, AVAX is undergoing a necessary correction before potentially resuming its upward trajectory. Recently, AVAX broke below its immediate support level set at $30, a psychologically significant threshold. However, the price breakdown is showing signs of recovery, suggesting that the dip might lead to an overshoot sell-off scenario.Weekly Analysis: Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern?A classic \"inverse head and shoulders\" pattern may potentially emerge on the weekly timeframe, as the candles show an extended breakdown followed by a recovery candle. With the price heavily supported by historical key levels and the 100-day moving average, this pattern is likely to materialize. To confirm a shift in momentum following the correction, the price needs to break above the $30 mark.Daily Analysis: Short-Term IndicatorsTo match the weekly timeframe pattern of an inverse head and shoulders, the daily candles need to penetrate above the $30 mark to confirm a shift in momentum. As shown in the screenshot above, the green pathway indicates the potential bullish move, suggesting that the price should break above the $30 mark and retest it. Conversely, the red pathway indicates a bearish scenario where the price fails to breach above $30.Key Points to Watch-\tSupports:$20 as immediate support.-\tResistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $30.Where are the targets?-\tBullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $30, the $39.37 price could be the next target.-\tBearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $20.86."}]}

Despite a rough two-week bearish sentiment in the market, KASPA maintained its upward trajectory on both the daily and weekly timeframes. This resilience is supported by a recent update on Marathon\u2019s KASPA mining operations. In May 2023, Marathon began evaluating Kaspa as a potential way to diversify its revenue while utilizing its existing infrastructure and expertise in digital assets. After successfully deploying its first Kaspa ASICs in September 2023, the company scaled its operations. As of June 25, 2024, Marathon has mined 93 million KAS, valued at approximately $15 million. This development could potentially drive KASPA\u2019s price to new all-time highs soon.Market Movement and Technical Structure-\t20-Day Moving Average Trail:Presently, KASPA bounced from the 20-day moving average as its steady upward movement is objectively reflected in it on the weekly timeframe, with the price closely following this indicator since October 2022. This consistent adherence to the moving average suggests a healthy and sustained uptrend, providing confidence to mid-term and long-term investors.-\tMarket Technical Structure:KASPA is way too far from the danger zone and is tagged as a bullish structure while it prepares for another take off and potentially making another record high soon.-\tRelative Strength Index (RSI):Since the beginning of KASPA's uptrend, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has consistently remained above the middle line on the weekly timeframe, never dipping into bearish territory. This sustained bullish momentum indicates strong long-term potential for the coin.Weekly Analysis: Cup and Handle PatternA classic cup and handle pattern has emerged as KASPA's price recovers from the past two weeks\u2019 market correction. Currently, KASPA\u2019s trading price is within the range of the \u201chandle\u201d pattern, gradually moving upward and poised for a breakout soon. Backed by the catalyst of Marathon\u2019s mining operations, if the general market\u2019s \u201cfear and greed index\u201d shifts towards optimism, another rally can be expected for this cryptocurrency.Daily Analysis: Approaching All-Time HighIn the shorter timeframe, KASPA is on the verge of breaking out, with the price close to challenging the previous all-time high, now less than 10% away from the current level. Coinciding with this is its relative strength index (RSI), which is preparing to enter overbought levels. Supported by a shift in the general market's momentum, a break above RSI70 could signal the start of a parabolic move.Key Inflection Points-\tSupports:$0.1441 is the immediate support level, with $0.113 following closely behind.-\tResistance:The nearest resistance is the previous all-time high pegged at $0.1939.Where are the targets?-\tBullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period is drawn at a Fibonacci level pegged at the $0.2452 mark since no resistance can be plotted due to another all-time high value.-\tBearish Targets:A break below $0.1411 could potentially lead the price down to $0.0113."}]}

Although Bitcoin\u2019s price is still sitting near the danger zone, the recovery from below $60,000 moving up to roughly $63,000 suggests that it has experienced a significant decrease in sell-side pressure and that the bulls have been trying to push the price back to higher levels. This price action was accompanied by a slight increase in Bitcoin reserves held by exchanges. Alongside the increase in Bitcoin on exchanges, there has been a noticeable uptick in the creation of new Bitcoin addresses.What\u2019s Influencing Market Sentiment?-\tDifferent Angle of Mount Gox Bitcoin Repayment:As the news last week regarding the Mount Gox Bitcoin repayment causes selling pressure, another angle appears to be worth considering. Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy, suggests that less than half of these coins will be available for sale on the open market, and recipients are likely to hold their BTC rather than sell immediately. He also stated that many have sold their bankruptcy claims to funds at a discount. He estimates that around 20,000 of the Bitcoin is held in these funds. This may not be the catalyst everyone is looking for but it somehow reduces the fear sentiment in the general market.-Technical Stance:Following last week\u2019s price dipped below $60,000, BTC somehow recovered and even closed above the $62,000 mark. The weekly closing candle confirms a potential swing setup as it forms a hammer candle which is a sign of reversal for the technical analyst traders/investors including the psychological support valued at $60,000.Is a Weekly Reversal Possible?Bitcoin attempted to drop below psychological support but lately recovered during the closing of the weekly candle. The drop that happened twice last week could potentially confirm a classic market manipulation hunting stop losses for retail investors and traders.Presently, Bitcoin\u2019s current price hovers near the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe. It is still below the said moving average which confirms a slightly bearish sentiment. However, the price it is currently sitting is the low of the 3-month range thus potentially poised for another swing setup.Lastly, Bitcoin's relative strength index (RSI) still hovers above the middle line or above the RSI50. This indicates that the consolidation over the longer timeframe is still bullish.What Are the Daily IndicatorsBitcoin is seen under a very narrow consolidation pegged at $58,500 to $63,322, a one-candle consolidation over the last 8 days. The high of the range is considered its immediate resistance as it coincides with multiple resistances including a short-term trendline pegged at $62,672 and the 20-day moving average which is also where the price is currently reacting to. A break above this resistance does not guarantee a bullish rally but it somehow destroys the short-term downtrend.What Are the Key Levels?-\tSupport:$60,256 as immediate support, followed by $56,900.-\tResistance:BTC needs to break above $65,500 to confirm a bullish structure or a healthy pullback.What Are the Targets?-\tBullish Targets:The nearest target for now is pegged at $65,000.-\tBearish Targets:If the $60,000 mark breaks down, Bitcoin\u2019s price is projected to drop at $56,000."}]}

It attempted to enter the bearish trajectory of the Darvas Box but eventually rebounded during the closing of the weekly session. On the weekly timeframe, Ethereum ended with a hammer-shaped candle, signalling a potential trend reversal. After a four-week consecutive decline, last week's price action closed positively. Although the price did not close above the $3,500 level, it hovered around it, confirming the beginning of a momentum shift.What Are the Support Levels?Last week\u2019s price projection materialized as the projected multiple support confluences reacted to Ethereum\u2019s fake-out drop. The following supports are:-\t20-day Moving Average:Since the 2024 rally, Ethereum\u2019s price highly respects the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe. It can be seen historically that this is the current moving average Ethereum has been hovering to.-\tHistorical Price Level:The $3,500 price level marked as the previous breakout zone can now be considered as the immediate support while the price has kept on retesting it. This is considered as the flip zone, a previous breakout zone now acting as support.-\tFibonacci 50:Lastly, the weekly bullish engulfing candle\u2019s range is also worth considering. The Fibonacci 50 of the candle seen in the screenshot should hold to confirm a bullish sentiment on Ethereum\u2019s price action.What\u2019s the Weekly Outlook?Ethereum is still considered underperforming despite the approval of its ETF product. Its performance has been significantly impacted by the general market conditions, including Bitcoin's recent price action as it has been consolidating for roughly three months. However, while the general market has not yet entered a legitimate bull run, Ethereum holders can now take advantage of the current bargain price of the coin.What Are the Daily Indicators?On the short-term timeframe, Ethereum has finally breached the trendline resistance, a level it struggled to surpass over the last 24 days. Despite multiple attempts to stay on the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box, last week\u2019s price action induced fear as Ethereum\u2019s price dropped below $3,300. However, the price quickly recovered, hovering near the strong 100-day moving average (100MA) for almost a week.

Until June 7th, it held above the 0.13 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high. However, on June 13th, it definitively dropped below this level, breaking the uptrend that had been sustained since October 2023.Given that it recently rejected the lower margin of that zone at $5.36 to the upside, this could give a higher probability of a rebound, although it will ultimately be decided in the $6.54 - $6.78 zone if the price is strong enough to ride back above the uptrend line and bounce to the upside again.What Are the Short-Term Price Targets?As mentioned in the previous analysis, to have a considerable rebound to the upside, it is important for the price to:Firstly, ride above the 0.13 Fibonacci level from the last low, located at $6.54,Reject the reversal zone at $6.78,Lastly, climb back above the uptrend line that has been in place since October 2023.In case these three points are fulfilled, an entry at $7.35 with a higher level of confirmation and therefore with a higher probability of success could occur.A riskier entry with a lower confirmation level would be at $6.8, once the price has exited the reversal zone from the October 2023 low.What Are the Acquisition Goals?"}]}

Despite this resilience,the attack did cause disruptions for some stake pool operators and raised concerns about network vulnerabilities.

This drop was influenced by the broader market sentiment as both Bitcoin and Ethereum fell below significant key levels. Following the trend of these larger cryptocurrencies, NEAR also broke below the $5.00 mark. Currently, NEAR is trying to establish a base near structural support. Despite positive updates, including the addition of 12.3 million new users in June, the overall market remains fearful, making it challenging for NEAR\u2019s price to return above the $6.00 mark.Market Movement AnalysisThere were two factors that affected the general market sentiment last week.-\tMount Gox Bitcoin Repayment:Mt.

This week\u2019s price action suggests a potential pause in selling pressure, possibly ending with a doji candle, which could indicate a shift in momentum. The relative strength index (RSI) supports this anticipation, as it continues to hover close to the middle line. If the RSI surpasses the 50 mark, it will signal the start of a swing high move.Daily Technical\u00a0 AnalysisThe bearish projection from last week materialized as the daily timeframe candles faced resistance near the 20-day moving average, causing the price to retest the recent low at $4.00. Despite attempts to break above the 20-day moving average and establish a higher-high structure last week, the price failed to sustain its upward momentum due to a broader market correction following Bitcoin\u2019s sell-off. Currently, the price is sitting at its immediate support level of $4.00, presenting two potential scenarios:Bullish Scenario: If the price holds above the $4.00 level, it could trigger a short rally above the $6.00 mark. This would then lead to a retest near the $5.50 mark to confirm a break in market structure.Bearish Scenario: If the $4.00 support breaks down, NEAR\u2019s price might drop further and could be bought at the $3.00 level.Key Inflection PointsSupports:The immediate price support is $4.00, with subsequent support at $3.00Resistance:Surpassing the $5.5 mark could drive the price up to $6.70.What Are the Bullish and Bearish Targets?Bullish Targets:The coin has potentially discovered its base and is already on a retest as of this week\u2019s price action. If breakout above $5.5 occurs over the next few days, the $7.00 mark can be tagged as the nearest target for the bulls.Bearish Targets:For an overall bearish sentiment of the general market, NEAR can drop to as low as $3.00."}]}

The weekly timeframe indicates that SOL may still experience some pullback before making another leg up, influenced by the general market sentiment and Bitcoin\u2019s recent price decline. Structurally, SOL has the potential for a larger swing high, as the price has already retested its immediate base.Market Movement AnalysisSolana ETF Hype:Last month, 21Shares has filed for a spot Solana ETF with the U.S. SEC. Another player, 3iQ, has applied for a Solana (SOL) Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) on the Toronto Stock Exchange. If approved, this would be the first Solana ETF in North America. This type of development is expected to positively impact the rest of Solana's ecosystem, including projects like WIF, RENDER, AR, and its meme coin POPCAT, as they stand to benefit from increased attention and investment in Solana.Weekly Technical AnalysisSolana\u2019s four-week price consolidation continues as the $130 mark supported heavily last week after following the bloody market correction caused by the German Government\u2019s Bitcoin liquidation. Despite the positive structure of SOL, the 20-day moving average is starting to act as resistance, pushing the price back and challenging its attempt to stay above the $150 level. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that SOL cannot break through, as it has already breached the key level pegged at $140. This week, SOL\u2019s price action has been strong, staying inside the wider range despite the correction last week. For SOL to have a chance for another leg up, the immediate base created last week must continue to hold.Daily Technical AnalysisSolana\u2019s attempt to break the market structure failed as both the 100-day and 50-day moving averages acted as resistances, causing the price to drop below the $130 mark. However, it eventually recovered and stayed above this level. Currently, SOL is retesting support at the $130 mark, bouncing and breaching the 20-day moving average, and potentially challenging the $150 mark soon. As SOL continues its short-term ranging movement, two potential scenarios could unfold this week:Bullish Scenario:The price enters and stays above the $150 level, confirming a break in market structure.Bearish Scenario:SOL\u2019s price may move towards the demand zone at the $90 mark if it fails to maintain its current support at $130.Both scenarios are backed by the potential movement of its relative strength index (RSI), which hovers near the middle line. If the RSI breaks above the middle line, the bullish scenario could materialize. Otherwise, the bearish scenario may occur, potentially leading to a drop below the $100 mark.Inflection PointsSupports:$130 as immediate support, followed by $120.Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $160TargetsBullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $150, the $165 price could be the next target.Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $80."}]}

Currently, FTM is retesting its potential established base level, which ranges between $0.40 and $0.55. Holders remain partly optimistic due to Fantom's transition to Sonic, a layer-1 blockchain enhanced by a layer-2 network that interfaces with Ethereum. An analyst, Bitcoin Ape, highlights Fantom's transition to Sonic and recent developments, such as Sonic Labs and a $100 million airdrop of Sonic's native token, as potential attractions for developers and users. Despite these positive developments, FTM\u2019s price action is still influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s recent support exploration.Market Movement AnalysisSonic Labs Partnership:Following Fantom's partnership with Sonic Labs to launch the Sonic Labs Innovator Fund, which will contribute up to 200 million FTM to expedite the integration of partners and dApps into the Sonic network, the Fantom Foundation announced on X that they will airdrop 190M $S tokens to Opera and Sonic users. Despite this development, FTM\u2019s price has plunged due to the general market sentiment.Weekly Technical AnalysisFantom (FTM) saw a significant key level fail to hold last week, with the price breaking below the $0.60 mark. Currently, the price sits close to the 100-day moving average, supported by historical key levels around $0.40. With four more trading days remaining this week, the candle could close on the positive side after seven consecutive days of negative closes. The relative strength index (RSI) also hovers below the RSI50, suggesting a longer consolidation period ahead.Daily Technical AnalysisFollowing last week\u2019s ascending channel movement on the daily timeframe, with the price respecting this pattern over the past two weeks, Fantom (FTM) has failed to sustain its position within the channel. This drop was potentially caused by the 20-day moving average, as the price continues to face resistance each time it approaches this level. Currently, FTM is sitting on a demand zone around the $0.40 level, presenting two potential scenarios:Bullish Scenario:If the price breaks above the $0.60 mark and successfully retests to confirm a break of market structure, it could drive the price up to the $0.70 level.Bearish Scenario:If the $0.40 support breaks down, FTM\u2019s price might drop further, potentially finding support at the $0.30 level.Key Inflection PointsSupports:$0.40 is the immediate support level, with $0.30 following closely behind.Resistance:$0.65 is the next immediate resistance considering this is a whole number resistance, followed by $0.90TargetsBullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period, is set at $0.90.Bearish Targets:Fantom's market dynamics suggest a possible challenge to the $0.36 support level if selling pressure persists."}]}

Currently, the broader market is stabilizing as Bitcoin tries to maintain its position above the historical support level at $56,000, which marks the low of its current range. Despite speculations surrounding an AVAX ETF, the overall fearful market sentiment, exacerbated by Bitcoin's struggle to stay above $60,000, has hindered AVAX's ability to rebound to recent highs.The main factors driving this decline- General Market Sentiment:AVAX has fallen below the $30.00 level and continues to struggle to stay above it, with indicators such as the 50-day moving average on the weekly timeframe acting as resistances. This decline is primarily driven by Bitcoin\u2019s price correction last week, which was caused by selling pressure from the German government's BTC asset liquidation and the recent activation of Mt.Gox's wallets for repayments.What does the weekly chart show?The classic \"inverse head and shoulders\" pattern identified last week has yet to fully materialize, but it remains a possibility as the recent low has not been breached. The \u201chead\u201d of the pattern will become apparent once the price breaks above the high of its current short-term range, pegged at $30. Additionally, another bullish angle is emerging as the price breaks out of the current trendline. Since March 2024, AVAX has respected this trendline, dropping each time it neared it and struggling to stay above it. Currently, the price has breached this resistance line for the first time. To confirm a shift in momentum following the correction, AVAX needs to break above the $30 mark.What\u2019s happening daily?AVAX's attempt to break the market structure failed as the 20-day moving average acted as resistance, causing the price to drop from $30 down to $21.88. Despite last week\u2019s bloody market environment, AVAX remained inside its potential immediate base, with the $25 mark holding and forming a double bottom. This is complemented by a classic formation of a bullish divergence on its relative strength index. As AVAX continues its attempt to break above the $30 mark soon, two potential scenarios could unfold this week:Bullish Scenario:The price breaks above the $30 mark, potentially moving higher up to $40 before it makes a retest near the break of the market structure zone pegged at $30.Bearish Scenario:If the immediate base fails to support, a breakdown is imminent, potentially seeing the price drop below the $20 mark.Key Points to Watch-\tSupports:$25 as immediate support.-\tResistance:The $30 mark is the immediate but stronger resistance as this holds a significant level historically.Where are the targets?-\tBullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $30, the $37.20 price could be the next target.-\tBearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $9.07."}]}

Last week, the general market sentiment shifted as Bitcoin\u2019s psychological support pegged at $60,000 failed to sustain leaving the rest of the market extremely fearful causing a selling pressure. The drop was also accompanied by the German government liquidating their BTC assets. Despite these market scenarios, KASPA\u2019s performance remains to be an outlier among the rest of the cryptocurrency market.How did KASPA perform- General Market Sentiment:Driven by Bitcoin\u2019s price correction last week, which was caused by selling pressure from the German government's BTC asset liquidation and the recent activation of Mt.Gox's wallets for repayments, KAS also experienced the correction but immediately recovered and even stayed in the bullish trajectory of the range.The weekly chart speaksThe projected classic cup and handle pattern emerging last week can still be at play as\u00a0 KASPA's price continues to stay inside the \u201chandle\u201d pattern after following a failed breakout caused by the overall market sentiment.\u00a0 Currently, KASPA\u2019s trading price is still ranging in the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box with the candles hovering close to the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe. Backed by the catalyst of Marathon\u2019s mining operations, if the general market\u2019s \u201cfear and greed index\u201d shifts towards optimism, another rally can be expected for this cryptocurrency.What\u2019s happening daily?KASPA is currently hovering above the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box following its failed attempt to break above the all-time high price due to several market factors such as the general market sentiment and its market structure itself.\u00a0 Coinciding with this is its relative strength index (RSI), which clearly shows a bearish divergence pattern suggesting a pullback and consolidation to occur over the next few days. While KAS hovers close to the 20-day moving average on the daily timeframe, two potential scenarios could happen this week:- Bullish Scenario:A break above the $0.20 mark making another record of all-time high as the entire market potentially settles down and might prepare for another round of rally.- Bearish Scenario:If the case breaks below the middle line of the Darvas Box, entering the bearish trajectory, the price could revisit the $0.10 mark. However, KAS\u2019s price is so strong that the bearish scenario is only projected in the short term.However, near the middle line, the relative strength index of KASPA can back both scenarios above. If the RSI stays above the middle line, the bullish scenario could materialize. Otherwise, the bearish scenario may occur, potentially leading to a drop below the $0.14 mark.Key Inflection Points- Supports:$0.1441 is the immediate support level, with $0.113 following closely behind.- Resistance:The nearest resistance is the previous all-time high pegged at $0.1939.Where are the targets?- Bullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period is drawn at a Fibonacci level pegged at the $0.2452 mark since no resistance can be plotted due to another all-time high value.- Bearish Targets:A break below $0.1411 could potentially lead the price down to $0.0113."}]}

This drop, driven by sell-offs from the German government, brought Bitcoin's price near the $54,000 mark, with projections indicating a potential further decline to the nearest support level of around $48,000. However, over the past month, Germany has already liquidated 82% of its Bitcoin reserves, selling nearly 41,000 BTC. Despite this significant sell-off by the German government, Bitcoin's price has remained relatively stable at around $57,000 due to strong inflows in ETFs.Navigating Bitcoin's Critical Levels-Bitcoin is trying to establish itself as a new base below the current range of $73,800 - to $56,500. At the moment, it's attempting to breach the $60,000 level again with immediate support pegged at $56,000. A worth considering level is the $56,500 since this has historically been significant and is the lowest of the wider range this year.-During Bitcoin\u2019s drop below $60,000, it had a domino effect. With immediate support levels at $58,000 and $56,000 failing to hold, it might lead to a potential revisit near the $50,000 mark. This level serves as a psychological benchmark for many investors and coincides with the 50-day moving average, which hovers around $48,000.-Once BTC finally recovers and stays inside the range, this week\u2019s price action might be considered a false breakdown move by the market movers. This is a classic move of hunting stop losses to retail investors and traders.Weekend expectations1.\tBitcoin\u2019 twice attempt to break above the $60,000 mark over the past two days indicates that it does not have enough strength yet and still has more room on the downside as the immediate support is projected near the $48,000 levels coinciding with the 50-day moving average on the weekly timeframe.2.\tBitcoin Dominance to stay and hover close to the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe as historically, it has been respecting its move since March of 2023. Its price action could move to as low as 54.88%, the low of its current range. BTCDom\u2019s consolidation typically takes longer and requires significant fundamental events to cause wild spikes in the chart.3. Once Bitcoin continues to drop and approaches the $48,000 mark, a bounce can be expected, potentially moving towards $55,000. This 12% upside could materialize, encouraging short-term holders to actively participate in the bounce play.Snapshot-Bitcoin recently retested the immediate support pegged at $56,000 while hovering close to the 20-day moving average on the daily timeframe which acts as the immediate resistance.-BTC.Dom continues to hover near the 20-day moving average while volatility is low during weekends.-BTC.Dom relative strength index remains above the RSI50 indicating a potential dominance over the next few days leaving Bitcoin to revisit the $50,000 mark.Weekend and Monday OutlookBitcoin remains in the danger zone as it hovers close to the low of its current range. To alleviate the fearful sentiment in the overall market, Bitcoin needs to hold the $56,500 mark while Bitcoin Dominance (BTCDom) stays flat and close to the 54% mark. Despite the recent drop caused by the German government's sell-off, it has been recorded that they have already executed almost 80% of their Bitcoin sales, leaving them with roughly 20% of their BTC assets. This suggests a potential reduction in selling pressure on the general market.Forecast Flash-If BTCDom breaks above the 57% level and BTC sits close to $50,000, a huge bounce could occur, leaving Bitcoin to hit above the $55,000 mark."}]}

The primary factor contributing to the general market correction was the German government selling Bitcoin last week. Despite this scenario, Bitcoin is striving to stay above its significant level pegged at $60,000, which could be very beneficial for the altcoin markets.TOTAL3's False Breakout: Market Makers' Classic MoveThe TOTAL3 index remained sluggish this week following last Friday\u2019s potential reversal candle, which signalled short-term strength for the bears. The total altcoin market cap has yet to find its support as it breaches below the low of its range. However, this week\u2019s price action could indicate a classic move by market makers known as a false breakout. This tactic aims to hunt stop-losses of retail traders and investors, shaking them out of their positions before initiating another set of rallies in the future. This move is also supported by the 50-day moving average on the weekly timeframe, which is beginning to act as an intermediate support.Snapshot-The TOTAL3 breaks below the $560B mark which is the Darvas Box support confirming a potential bearish sentiment not unless it recovers back to the range. This suggests that sellers are potentially resting and might continue the downward trend over the next few days.-Another angle to anticipate in TOTAL3\u2019s move is a potential false breakout which suggests a classic market manipulation. If the price recovers above the $600B mark, it indicates the start of the buying season for the rest of the market participants.Weekend and Monday OutlookWhile Bitcoin is regarded as the primary driver of the market and its recent price action continues to challenge the nearest resistance at the $60,000 mark, the altcoin market could benefit from this move as some investors might opt to invest in other potential movers besides the two largest cryptocurrencies. Although no significant catalysts are anticipated over the weekend, aside from general market sentiments such as fear and greed, some altcoins may not have bottomed out yet. It is still advisable to continuously monitor their positions as the market remains extremely volatile.Forecast Flash-Bitcoin to hover close to the $55,000 mark to avoid another bloodbath season."}]}

These initiatives aim to streamline crypto transactions and expand access to NEAR\u2019s ecosystem, despite internal restructuring challenges. Notably, daily transaction volumes have shown volatility, with recent rebounds indicating potential bullish trends.Recent AI-related developments have positively impacted NEAR\u2019s price during late June, with increased buying pressure and heightened development activity. The integration of AI and blockchain technology, coupled with strategic investments from firms like Panthera Capital, suggests a promising upward trajectory. On-chain data reflects a rise in NEAR\u2019s volume, which could further support price increases.What has happened with NEAR this week?This week's most important news for the crypto market and its impact on NEAR\u2019s price development were as follows:-However, NEAR has faced recent declines in network activity, leading to decreased transaction volumes and revenue. Despite this, technical indicators suggest that if buying pressure increases, NEAR could see a price rally. Overall, the market shows mixed signals, but strategic developments and increasing transaction volumes point to potential growth.-Furthermore, the price of NEAR has bounced off a key support for its development on Friday 5 July, which is the $4 price zone, a psychological level that also coincides with the 0.61 Fibonacci level from its October 2023 low. In principle, this would be a good signal that could give a higher probability of a rebound to the upside for NEAR.-Apparently and regardless of the general weakness of the market, NEAR Protocol has also processed 450 million transactions and reached 12.3 million unique addresses by July 2024, reflecting its rising popularity. In June, it recorded 16.9 million unique addresses, facilitated 240 million transactions with a 99.7% success rate, and demonstrated high efficiency with 94.5 successful transactions per second.Recent Price MovementsNEAR has recently bounced off the $4 price zone, which represents the beginning of the reversal zone traced from its October 2023 low.This in principle would be a sign that the mentioned support is a strong area and that the price would find resistance to break it.The real resistance that the NEAR price would have to break to show that there is a willingness of the bulls to go higher is the $5.6 area, where the last relative highs are located, and which has proven to be a barrier for the price to continue its upward path.Future PerspectivesIn case the NEAR price breaks downwards from the $4 price zone, the next levels could be $3.7 - $3.44 - $2.69 according to the reversal zone from the October 2023 low.To show bullish strength, the price should break $5.6 as mentioned, and an entry to the upside could be at $5.68, with targets from $6.77.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesFantom (FTM)-FTM has rejected to the upside the $0.4 area, which represents the end of its reversal zone drawn from its October 2023 low. In the case of holding this zone, there would be chances of a bullish bounce, but in the case of losing it, the price could go to $0.31 and even lower levels like $0.17.Kaspa (KAS)-KAS has recently rejected the $0.17 area on the downside and is in a range from $0.14 to $0.17. Should it break to the upside, it would be more likely to approach the ATH level. If it breaks $0.14 to the downside, it could head towards $0.135 which is the level of the June low."}]}

The launch of Hydro and fee-free Bitcoin bridges via the Cosmos DAO highlights its growing ecosystem, pointing to strong future growth.Adding to this, the new Valence cross-chain protocol aims to boost the interchain ecosystem by creating programmatic connections between crypto-native organizations. This could lead to wider adoption, stronger economic ties within the Cosmos network and better capital efficiency across connected ecosystems, potentially stabilising and increasing ATOM's market value and positioning Cosmos as a key player in blockchain interoperability.What has happened with ATOM this week?This week's most important news for the crypto market and its impact on Quant\u2019s price development were as follows:-After Bitcoin broke 60k, which was the lower limit of the range it had held since late February, the entire market increased its medium-term bearish trend, with the vast majority of assets going down and touching important supports, some even breaking them.-In the case of ATOM, having recently rejected $5 support to the upside is an important indicator that the price could start a floor formation in the current zone, but it is absolutely necessary for Bitcoin to recover strongly from the current 57k zone towards 60k and back into the range and even 64k to show bullish strength again.-Bitcoin's recent decline, along with the broader crypto market, is due to several factors. A key reason in June was the announcement that customers who lost funds in the Mt. Gox exchange collapse 10 years ago would finally be repaid in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. With Mt. Gox's reserves holding over 147,000 Bitcoins, the repayment process by the Rehabilitation Trustee began on July 5th, a move the market had anticipated. This influx of Bitcoin could increase selling pressure as investors seek to quickly recover their lost capital.-Additionally, bearish news for BTC includes the German government selling 80% of the 50,000 Bitcoins recovered from a pirated movie website in exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp. This move raised concerns among investors, as it signalled the government offloading its Bitcoin holdings, adding to the selling pressure.-Lastly, the 50% cut in block rewards from April\u2019s halving has forced miners to sell their holdings, with large-size miners selling about $300M and mid-size miners around $500M since June 20, according to CryptoQuant. Additionally, concerns about weak real estate markets, particularly in China, and potential corporate earnings disappointments in the second half of 2024 have led investors to seek protection in cash positions, negatively impacting risk-on assets like Bitcoin.Recent Price MovementsATOM has fallen below the $6.18 level, which was the last relevant support for its price, but nevertheless managed to hold the $5 support, fundamental as it is a critical psychological level.However, its short-term outlook is more likely to continue downwards, and this probability increases if it does not regain the $6.3 level, which is where the October 2023 low is located.Should it break the psychological level of $5, the price could head towards $3.88 - $3.4.Future PerspectivesIn case the price breaks $5.29 - $5 again strongly to the downside, the next levels would be $3.88 - $3.4, and in case of a candlestick break of these levels, $1.95 - $0.95 could be visited.In the event of a bullish bounce, the price should strongly break above the $6.3 level and ideally $7.28 to show that the bulls are willing to put up a fight to stop ATOM's price from continuing downwards.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesPolkadot (DOT):-DOT has had a negative week, using as support the 0.13 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high, which if not supported, could take the price back to near $5.Quant (QNT):-QNT has used the $68.4 support to stay afloat and end the week in positive territory.

The reclamation of this level holds significant value, acting as a psychological resistance for many investors, especially traders. Technically, the range's low was pegged at the $56,500 level, but the whole number potentially holds greater value due to its psychological impact. This whole number resistance is crucial as it is often considered by investors who may not closely monitor charts but look at overall value or price.Bitcoin's Surge Amid Political Events and Final BTC Liquidation-\tTrump Effect?:Bitcoin price rises despite Trump's assassination attempt.Bitcoin's value has increased in the last 24 hours, coinciding with the news of an assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump.

Bitcoin\u2019s price recovered and closed strong on the weekly candle, ending four consecutive negative closings. Currently, Bitcoin\u2019s price is close to challenging the middle line of the Darvas Box and will enter the bullish trajectory of the range once the breakout attempt is successful. However, an immediate resistance is pegged at $66,000 as the 20-day moving average is hovering around this level.Behind Daily CandlesLast week\u2019s projected price action of Bitcoin\u2019s false breakdown has been confirmed as Bitcoin recovers and stays inside the range. Currently, Bitcoin has breached the immediate range on the daily timeframe and has potentially established a higher low structure, breaking the short-term trendline. This is supported by the relative strength index (RSI) breaking above the RSI50 level, indicating potential bullish momentum. As Bitcoin continues to move towards the middle line of the Darvas Box, two possible scenarios could unfold this week:Bullish Scenario:The price is likely to encounter resistance near the $66,000 mark due to confluence from two moving averages and a historical key level. Despite an expected price correction at this level, Bitcoin could potentially breach it afterwards, signalling an early sign of a rally towards an all-time high.Bearish Scenario:Given the strong resistance at the $66,000 level, the price might drop as multiple indicators act as immediate resistances. If the price resists and falls, it could go down to the low of the range or even breach below the $56,000 mark, causing fear that could lead Bitcoin\u2019s price down to the $48,000 level.Key Inflection Points-\tSupport:$60,000 as immediate support, followed by $56,500.-\tResistance:BTC needs to break above $66,000 to confirm a break of market structure or an end of the downtrend structure.Targets-\tBullish Targets:The nearest target for now is pegged at $66,000.-\tBearish Targets:If the $60,000 mark breaks down, Bitcoin\u2019s price is projected to drop at $48,000 as the $60,000 mark holds a psychological level."}]}

Its price stayed close to the low of the range, with the $2,800 level holding strongly despite the potential breakdown last week. While the ETF product is soon to be available in the market, ETH\u2019s status remains underperforming compared to other ecosystems that have already recorded new all-time highs.

Presently, ETH has rebounded from the range's support and is now attempting to enter the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box. This attempt faces multiple resistances, including the middle line of the Darvas Box, which holds historical significance. Additionally, the 20-day moving average hovers close to this middle line, potentially acting as resistance. Lastly, a trendline is also spotted that could serve as another resistance level.Daily ChartEthereum is currently attempting to breach the short-term trendline resistance on the daily timeframe, which coincides with the 100-day moving average acting as a resistance. This attempt is further challenged by a key level resistance pegged at $3,500, aligning with the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box. As Ethereum moves towards the middle line of the Darvas Box, two potential scenarios could unfold this week:- Bullish Scenario:Ethereum's price could successfully enter the bullish trajectory of the box if it breaches the $3,500 level and subsequently retests this level as support. In this scenario, all moving averages on the daily timeframe will act as support, with the candle staying above all three moving averages.- Bearish Scenario:Ethereum is expected to drop once it reaches the $3,500 level due to multiple resistances, including the 50-day moving average and the middle line of the Darvas Box. During the price correction, if the $3,000 mark fails to hold, Ethereum\u2019s price could drop as low as $2,800.Key Inflection Points-\tSupports:$3,000 as immediate support, followed by $2,800-\tResistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $3,300.What Are the Targets?-\tBullish Targets:At the moment, the nearest target for ETH is projected at $3,500.-\tBearish Targets:While the price will surely hit the nearest resistance at $3,500, the price could drop to as low as $2,800 given a very bearish market sentiment."}]}

As BTC's price strengthens and approaches the immediate resistance at $66,000, BTC.Dom has the potential to enter the bullish side of the Darvas Box. This shift could indicate a renewed interest in Bitcoin over altcoins, influencing market dynamics.DXYWhat is the recent behaviour and short-term outlook for DXY?The DXY (US Dollar Index) breached the long-term trendline it has been respecting for a very long time. This is backed by all moving averages above the candle which could mean more room on the downside as a rate cut is coming close anytime this year. On the other angle, it could just be an over-extended correction and could recover or bounce back anytime soonS&P500How is the S&P500 currently performing and what does it imply?The S&P 500 continues to stand out as an outlier compared to other charts, demonstrating extreme strength and continuously setting new all-time high prices. A channel line can be spotted along its upward trajectory and is close to hitting resistance pegged at $5,900 levels.BTC.DomWhat is the future outlook for BTC.Dom?BTCDom is still inside the bearish trajectory of the Darvas Box, under a one-candle consolidation on the weekly timeframe, and is still hovering close to the 20-day moving average. It could remain close to the 55% level as Bitcoin is close to hitting the resistance pegged at $66,000.BTC - Indicators and strategy-Bearish:As Bitcoin rallies over close to the immediate resistance with a confluence indicator potentially resisting, the price may experience correction over the next few days. The optimal entry should be close to the middle line of the Darvas Box confluence to the 100-day moving average. The Risk to Reward Ratio for this play is very rewarding, roughly 1:5.-Bullish:Despite Bitcoin's strength over the past few days, the price is nearing a level with multiple resistances that are likely to reject the upward movement. These resistances include two moving averages, the midline of the Darvas Box, and the psychological value pegged at $66,000. However, a bullish play is possible if the inverse head and shoulders pattern materializes. The optimal entry is at the right shoulder, offering a potential reward of sixfold.Connecting the DotsWhat is the overall market outlook?As Bitcoin reclaimed the $60,000 mark yesterday, on a Sunday, it strongly suggests an end to the selling pressure. This is supported by the completion of the German Government\u2019s final tranche of their Bitcoin selling. Although Bitcoin is close to hitting resistance and potentially retracing to the $60,000 level, Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.Dom) is projected to remain sluggish as no significant catalysts are anticipated over the next few days to drive Bitcoin's price significantly. While the DXY potentially has more room for downside movement, it could also be viewed as an overshoot of the correction. However, with the FED expected to cut rates soon, the DXY is likely to experience a bearish scenario, thereby favouring the rise of risk assets."}]}

According to data from Arkham Intelligence, the final transaction included 3,846 Bitcoin sent to Flow Traders and 139Po, \u201clikely institutional deposit/OTC service.\u201d-\tUser Engagement and AI Focus:The NEAR Protocol has seen a significant increase in user engagement and transaction volumes, drawing attention in the cryptocurrency community. The protocol's growth is attributed to its focus on scalability, low transaction fees, and an ambitious move towards integrating artificial intelligence (AI). In June, NEAR had the highest number of active addresses compared to other top chains, and it ranked second in terms of total transactions processed and average transaction speed.With these market developments, including the catalyst mentioned, NEAR's price is likely to be driven towards higher levels.Weekly Market InsightsFollowing a classic double bottom setup, NEAR's price respected the structural low on the weekly timeframe, with the $4.00 mark providing strong support and resulting in a 30% bounce. This week's price action suggests a potential strong close, as the price remains approximately 18% away from resistance. The relative strength index (RSI) supports this outlook, continuing its upward movement within a bullish trajectory. The RSI70, or overbought levels, is expected to provide resistance, potentially aligning with the price hovering close to the $7.00 mark.Daily Crypto TrendsThe bullish projection from last week materialized as the structural support held, and the daily candles started to move upward, breaching the 20-day moving average and triggering a short-term rally towards the immediate resistance at $7.00. NEAR is approaching a level with potential multiple resistance scenarios, including the 50-day moving average and the historical key level near the $7.00 mark. Additionally, the overbought levels of the relative strength index (RSI) are pegged near $7.00.Currently, the price has shifted its market structure, and two potential scenarios could unfold over the next few days:-Bullish Scenario:If the price breaks above $7.00 and holds after being retested, NEAR could reach a new record high this year, potentially surpassing the 52-week high.-Bearish Scenario:As NEAR approaches multiple resistances, a price correction is likely and could lead the price back to the $4.50 mark.Key Inflection Points- Supports:The immediate price support is $5.50, with subsequent support at $4.00- Resistance:As the price is moving towards the $7.00, a break on this level could hit the price close to the $9.00 mark.What Are the Targets?- Bullish Targets:The coin could hit as high as $9.00 if the general market continues to remain bullish despite a price correction coming anytime soon.- Bearish Targets:For an overall bearish sentiment of the general market, NEAR can drop to as low as $3.00."}]}

This positive sentiment was supported by the final tranche of the German Government\u2019s Bitcoin liquidation, which had caused significant selling pressure over the past two weeks. As Bitcoin continues to build strength above the critical $60,000 level, ADA is mimicking this move by finally breaching the $0.42 level, marking a necessary market structure shift for a potential change in momentum.Bitcoin Rises, Germany Sells, Cardano Updates- Bitcoin Rises Despite Attempt:Bitcoin price rises despite Trump's assassination attempt.Bitcoin's value has increased in the last 24 hours, coinciding with the news of an assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump.

The Chang Hardfork is a two-part Hardfork Combinator Event that Cardano will undergo this year to transition to full decentralized governance as outlined in CIP-1694. This significant milestone, announced by Charles Hoskinson on July 9th, 2024, with the release of Cardano Node 9.0.0, marks the first steps toward activating Minimal Viable Governance. This node contains all the necessary changes for the Conway Ledger Era.Weekly Market InsightsADA has finally broken out above the short-term trendline and is currently hovering near the 100-day moving average on the weekly timeframe. This breakout occurred last week, supported by a stronger base established at a structural low or a historical support level. Currently, ADA faces a challenging resistance at the 50-day moving average, which may act as an immediate barrier. This resistance is also aligned with its relative strength index (RSI) as it attempts to break above the RSI50 level. Due to its RSI status, ADA may experience a longer consolidation period, indicating that the price could remain sluggish for a while.Daily Crypto TrendsLast week\u2019s projected bullish price action materialized as the general market soared, following Bitcoin\u2019s upward movement. ADA broke out above the 20-day moving average and successfully breached the $0.40 level, which serves as a psychological resistance for traders and investors. Currently, ADA is attempting to break the 100-day moving average on the daily timeframe. Given that the general market sentiment is in a price correction phase, two potential scenarios could unfold this week:-Bullish Scenario:ADA\u2019s price could successfully breach the 100-day moving average, potentially rising to the $0.50 mark. However, a price correction is expected, and the $0.40 mark should hold to confirm a break of market structure and a shift in trend.-Bearish Scenario:ADA's price might correct in line with the general market\u2019s movement as it approaches the 100-day moving average. In this case, the price could revisit the $0.35 mark.Key Inflection Points-Supports:$0.40 as immediate support, followed by $0.35-Resistance:As ADA breaks above the $0.42 mark, the next level of resistance is pegged at $0.50.What Are the Targets?-Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $0.51, the $0.68 price could be the next target.-Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $0.25, the demand zone level."}]}

It currently hovers close to the 50-day moving average on the weekly timeframe and has the potential to reach as high as $0.60. Recently, Fantom has transitioned to Sonic, a layer-1 blockchain enhanced by a layer-2 network that interfaces with Ethereum. While this move may not have been fully priced in during the announcement, it could serve as an additional driver for its recent price action.FTM Moves Amid Bitcoin SurgeAs no recent update has been released by FANTOM, the potential drivers for FTM\u2019s move are the following:- Bitcoin Rises Despite Attempt:Bitcoin price rises despite Trump's assassination attempt.Bitcoin's value has increased in the last 24 hours, coinciding with the news of an assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump.

Currently, FTM is challenging the flip zone level, supported by the 50-day moving average on the weekly timeframe. If this attempt is successful, the next potential resistance is near the 20-day moving average, which coincides with a trendline resistance. However, as the general market may experience a price correction soon, FTM's relative strength index (RSI) may also reflect this movement.Daily Crypto TrendsFollowing last week's price action, FTM's projected bullish movement materialised as the demand zone reacted, causing the price to bounce roughly 15%. The bullish move is not yet complete, with the projected resistance pegged near the $0.70 mark, in confluence with the 100-day moving average on the daily timeframe. Currently, FTM has successfully breached the 20-day moving average, breaking above the significant psychological level at $0.50, and could follow two potential scenarios:Bullish Scenario:If the price continues its rally and breaks above the $0.60 mark, it could drive the price up to the $0.70 level.Bearish Scenario:If the $0.60 resistance holds due to bearish market sentiment, the price could drop as low as $0.30.Key Inflection Points- Supports:$0.50 is the immediate support level, with $0.40 following closely behind.- Resistance:$0.60 is the next immediate resistance considering this is a whole number resistance, followed by $0.80What Are the Targets?- Bullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period, is set at $0.90.- Bearish Targets:The immediate support is pegged at $0.40."}]}

After surpassing the $140 mark last Sunday, SOL broke the trendline, indicating an attempt to move beyond the danger zone below $130. The relative strength index on the daily timeframe suggests bullish momentum, with the price poised to challenge the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box. However, SOL may face immediate resistance as the price approaches the trendline resistance on the weekly timeframe, in confluence with the middle line of the Darvas Box.Solana's Major Updates and ETF Hype- Version 1.17 Update:Solana has rolled out the v1.17 update for its validator client. This update introduces several improvements aimed at enhancing the network's performance and resilience. Key features include the activation of the ZK Token proof program for confidential transfers, improvements in transaction latency, and faster validator startup times by using local state data. Additionally, the update enhances resiliency by supporting broadcast shreds and repair over the QUIC protocol\u200b-ZK Compression:Solana has introduced ZK compression, a technology that significantly reduces the cost of creating and maintaining token accounts. This innovation decreases the cost of creating 1,000 token accounts from $2,600 to just 50 cents. This reduction in costs allows developers to build more complex applications without worrying about high expenses, promoting greater scalability and user adoption\u200b (Solana Compass)\u200b.- Solana ETF Hype:Last month, 21Shares filed for a spot Solana ETF with the U.S. SEC. Another player, 3iQ, has applied for a Solana (SOL) Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) on the Toronto Stock Exchange. If approved, this would be the first Solana ETF in North America. This type of development is expected to positively impact the rest of Solana's ecosystem, including projects like WIF, RENDER, AR, and its meme coin POPCAT, as they stand to benefit from increased attention and investment in Solana.Weekly chart at a glanceAfter four weeks of consolidation, Solana has finally broken out of its one-candle consolidation and has even breached the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe. Although the weekly candle still has four more trading days, SOL\u2019s price could successfully hover above the 20-day moving average or even breach the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box as the general market continues to show strength. Notably, its relative strength index (RSI) has remained above the RSI50 despite the July 2024 sell-offs, suggesting that SOL and its ecosystem are among the strongest in the market.Daily Chart AnalysisSolana (SOL) successfully broke the market structure last week, breaching all moving averages on the daily timeframe. This type of market structure, with candles above all moving averages, suggests very strong support. The moving averages are aligning with the 100-day moving average below the 50-day MA, and the 50-day MA below the 20-day MA. As SOL remains above the $150 mark, two potential scenarios could unfold this week:- Bullish Scenario:The price continues its upward trajectory with a take profit target set at $190.- Bearish Scenario:With the general market projected to experience a price correction, SOL could face resistance at $170, which coincides with the middle line of the Darvas Box.Key Inflection Points- Supports:$150 as immediate support, followed by $130.- Resistance:The next line of resistance to break should be above $170What Are the Targets?- Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $170, the $190 price could be the next target.-Bearish Targets:The realistic target is set at $130."}]}

The introduction of Hydro and zero-fee Bitcoin bridges by the Cosmos DAO highlights its growing ecosystem, suggesting strong future potential.How Is the Ecosystem Evolving?Cosmos has recently launched the Valence cross-chain protocol, which seeks to enhance the interchain ecosystem by enabling programmable relationships between crypto-native organisations. This innovation aims to be a determining factor in mass adoption and increase deeper economic integration with the Cosmos network, with the ultimate consequence of stabilising and enhancing the market value of ATOM.Cosmos' innovation and growth efforts would lead to increased market adoption and capital efficiency across interconnected ecosystems, positioning Cosmos as a key player in network interoperability, which would indicate a promising upward trend for its ecosystem and market value.What Are the Market Movements?ATOM has bounced upwards at the $5.29 price zone, also rejecting the zone marked between $5.8 - $6.6 which represents the 1.27 - 1.61 Fibonacci levels from the last high, and which is currently a trend reversal zone. Nevertheless, the price should continue to hold $6.3 - $6.6 for this hypothesis to remain valid.As mentioned previously, a break above $7.28 would give ATOM greater bullish probabilities to go for at least the price zone near the last high at $8.69.What Are the Short-Term Price Targets?In case the $6.6-$6.3 price zone is rejected to the upside again, a first entry to the upside at $6.7 with higher risk and lower confirmation level may occur.In case the price breaks the $7.28 resistance, the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high would have been breached and an entry at $7.4 may be possible with higher confirmation level and probability of looking for a bullish bounce to ATOM.What Are the Acquisition Goals?"}]}

Despite its attempt to break above its immediate resistance, AVAX is currently experiencing a setup known as a moving average squeeze, where two moving averages corner the candles. This setup typically leads to a price pump when the candles experience extreme pressure between the moving averages, supported by a significant volume breakout. If this setup materialises, AVAX's price action suggests the start of upward momentum.Avalanche Expands with Key Partnerships-\tPartnerships and Integrations:Chainlink Integration:Chainlink data streams have gone live on the Avalanche network, with GMX, a perpetual futures trading platform, leveraging this technology\u200b.K-pop Industry Collaboration:Ava Labs has entered the K-pop industry by providing intellectual property management solutions, aiming to capitalize on the industry's projected value of $20 billion by 2031\u200b.Konami Partnership:Konami Digital Entertainment has teamed up with Avalanche to launch Resella, a platform for simplifying NFT creation, issuance, and trading\u200b\u200b.Weekly chart at a glanceIt took a while for the classic \"inverse head and shoulders\" pattern identified over the past few weeks to fully materialize, as the price continued to consolidate and faced challenges breaking above the $30.00 mark. Although the price has shown promise by breaking out above the trendline, the $30.00 level remains a significant challenge due to multiple confluence resistances. The 50-day moving average hovers close to this historical level, or flip zone, and these market conditions align with the psychological level of $30.00. Currently, AVAX is still under a one-candle consolidation on the weekly timeframe, and its relative strength index (RSI) suggests a longer consolidation period as it remains in the bearish trajectory, below RSI50.Daily Chart AnalysisAVAX continues its attempt to break the market structure as it remains above the trendline and has successfully breached the 20-day moving average on the daily timeframe, which acted as immediate resistance. Despite a strong recent market environment, AVAX struggles below the $30.00 mark, and its performance has been modest compared to other coins that have surged roughly 30% since last week's rally. While AVAX remains resilient in its attempt to break above the $30.00 mark soon, two scenarios could unfold this week:Bullish Scenario:AVAX successfully breaks above the $30.00 level, marking a break in the market structure and the start of a trend shift. This could suggest that the price may move as high as $40.00 before experiencing a correction.Bearish Scenario:If AVAX fails to break above the $30.00 resistance, the price could drop to $20.00.Key Points to Watch-\tSupports:$26.76 as immediate support, or the 20-day moving average on the daily timeframe.-\tResistance:The $30 mark is the immediate but stronger resistance as this holds a significant level historically.Where are the targets?-\tBullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $30, the $37.20 price could be the next target.-\tBearish Targets:AVAX had a short and steady upward movement close to the $30.00 mark if this immediate resistance reacted strongly, AVAX price could be seen at $9.00."}]}

Currently, KASPA is hovering close to the 20-day moving average on the daily timeframe, potentially preparing for another upward move. This is happening while the market has not fully corrected, despite the anticipated Bitcoin correction around the $66,000 mark. If the market correction occurs and KASPA stays above the middle line of the Darvas Box, it will clearly remain an outlier in the current market condition.Kaspa Boosts Global Community Engagement-Community Engagement:The Kaspa Chinese Community has been actively participating in biweekly space discussions, with the 13th episode focusing on Kasplex AMA\u200b.-Global Presence:Kaspa has been represented at various international events, including the World Digital Mining Summit in Oman and the Next Block Expo in Warsaw, Poland.-Meetups and Conferences:The Kaspa team has been busy with multiple events, including meetups in Japan and participation in conferences across the USA and Kazakhstan, which has helped in increasing its global footprint\u200b.Weekly Technical AnalysisThe classic cup and handle pattern has yet to be fulfilled as the support at the middle line of the Darvas Box has held for the past six weeks. Currently, KASPA's price remains within the \u201chandle\u201d pattern and is close to challenging the immediate resistance, being only 7% away from its previous all-time high. Despite the recent market sentiment starting to correct slowly, KAS\u2019s price remains very resilient. This resilience is supported by its momentum indicator, the relative strength index (RSI), which has consistently hovered above RSI50 since it began public trading.Daily Technical AnalysisKASPA is currently hovering above the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box and may soon challenge it's all-time high levels, following a strong market condition. However, its relative strength index (RSI) remains below RSI60, indicating a bullish consolidation that may take some time before transitioning into a parabolic move. As KAS approaches the 20-day moving average on the daily timeframe, two potential scenarios could unfold this week:-Bullish Scenario:KAS builds strength and breaks above the $0.20 mark, setting a new all-time high.-Bearish Scenario:If the breakout attempt fails, KAS could move towards the bearish trajectory of the Darvas Box or even drop to the low of its current range, pegged at $0.10.It is also worth noting that the RSI has not invalidated the bearish divergence pattern yet, which suggests that the bearish scenario could likely occur, especially as the general market condition begins to shift.Key Inflection Points-Supports:The next line of support is pegged at $0.1437with $0.10 following behind.-Resistance:The nearest resistance is the previous all-time high pegged at $0.1939.Where are the targets?-Bullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period is drawn at a Fibonacci level pegged at the $0.2452 mark since no resistance can be plotted due to another all-time high value.-Bearish Targets:A break below the 100-day moving average or below $0.1437 could potentially lead the price down to $0.113."}]}

However, thehigher percentage increase in SOL suggests a divergence likely driven by specific catalysts.Solana, Cardano, Avalanche: Ecosystem GrowthSolana's recent performancehas been significantly influenced by multiple positive developments within its ecosystem. Thecollaboration with DroppGroup to drive Web3 and AI integration in Saudi Arabia, aligned with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 initiative, has bolstered Solana's strategic position in a critical market. Furthermore, thehype surrounding Solana-based ETFs, with CBOE filing for Solana ETFs proposed by VanEck and 21Shares, has added to investor optimism, pushing Solana's market cap upward. Technologically,Solana's network improvements, including achieving a remarkable 1,504 transactions per second and resolving congestion issues, demonstrate its robust infrastructure and potential for high throughput. Thesurge in non-vote transactions, driven by the memecoin economy, underscores the increasing network activity and user engagement. Additionally, the protocol\u2019sstaking landscape reveals a growth opportunity, particularly in liquid staking, where it currently lags behind Ethereum but shows significant potential for expansion through protocols like Jito and Marinade Finance.Cardano's activitiesindicate a period ofsignificant development and strategic initiativesthat could positively influence its market cap and price. Theanticipation around the Chang hard fork, expected to bring community governance and decentralisation improvements, has generated excitement within the Cardano community. Although initially delayed, the reassurance from co-founder Charles Hoskinson about itsimminent launch in the second half of 2024has mitigated some concerns. Additionally, theresumption of the USDA stablecoin launchunder new ownership by Encryptus, a compliance-focused crypto firm, promises enhanced functionality and adoption, particularly through ADA-to-fiat conversions. Moreover,Hoskinson's proactive approach in pitching decentralised identifiers (DIDs) to Elon Musk for enhancing security on the social platform Xshowcases Cardano's commitment to practical, innovative applications of its technology. These developments highlight Cardano's ongoing efforts tostrengthen its ecosystem and expand its use cases reflecting growing investor confidenceand anticipation of future growth.Avalancheis experiencing robustgrowth and diversificationthroughstrategic partnerships and innovative initiatives, positioning itself as a key player in various industries. Theintegration with ContinuumDAO for seamless testnet integration enhances its technological capabilities, while collaborations with the gaming industry, notably through projects like Spellborne and Gamechain, highlight its appeal in the blockchain gaming sector.Additionally,its partnership with South Korean K-pop artistsfor intellectual property management showcases its expanding influence in entertainment. Thelaunch of \"Avalanche Vista,\" a $50 million program aimed at promoting tokenization of off-chain assets, further demonstrates its commitment to innovation and asset democratisation across sectors like real estate and venture capital. These multifaceted developments have likely contributed to a positive market sentiment, reflected in Avalanche's market cap and a price increase over the past week, as investors recognize the platform's expanding utility and potential for future growth."}]}

Bitcoin is now situated close to the middle line of the Darvas Box, indicating its potential attempt to enter the bullish trajectory of the wider consolidation levels. This bullish sentiment is bolstered by Bitcoin ETF inflows hitting a record of $1.05 billion and the news of Trump attending a Bitcoin conference despite an assassination attempt. These market scenarios coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s reclamation of the psychological $60,000 level. Currently, Bitcoin is hovering close to the two moving averages on the daily timeframe, potentially challenging the $65,000 mark over the weekend.Technical Analysis Insights\u2023After Bitcoin attempted to stay above the $56,500 support level, it has successfully moved away from the danger zone and breached a more significant level. Bitcoin still has room for further gains and could enter the bullish trajectory of the range anytime soon.\u2023Bitcoin\u2019s successful reclamation of the $60,000 mark coincided with two key technical indicators. When BTC breached the 20-day moving average, its relative strength index (RSI) also moved above the RSI50 level. Both breakouts confirm a bullish sentiment, significantly boosting investor confidence.Weekend Trends to Watch1.Bitcoin\u2019s attempt to break above the $60,000 mark on a Sunday indicates significant strength, sustaining the breakout over the following days and leading to the recent price of $63,700. Bitcoin can still gather momentum over the weekend, even with less volatility, as it stays above the 50-day moving average on the daily timeframe, while the 100-day moving average also squeezes the candles, providing additional support.2.Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.Dom) has successfully stayed above all the moving averages and is currently situated above the strongest moving average, the 100-day moving average. BTC.Dom could re-enter the middle line of the Darvas Box anytime, but it needs a significant catalyst for Bitcoin to gather substantial volume.3.A potential bearish scenario for Bitcoin is if the $66,000 mark strongly rejects, given the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe sits close to this price. In such a case, Bitcoin could nosedive and experience significant losses. The weekly timeframe suggests that Bitcoin still has more room on the downside and could potentially fall to the $48,000 level, where the 50-day moving average also resides.Snapshot\u2023Bitcoin recently retested the immediate support pegged at $56,000 and has successfully reclaimed the $60,000 mark.\u2023BTCDom has finally breached above all the moving averages after a week. It is currently staying above the 100-day moving average and has stayed close at the 55% mark.\u2023BTCDom\u2019s relative strength index remains above the RSI50 indicating a potential dominance over the next few days, leaving Bitcoin either revisit the $50,000 mark or challenge the previous all-time high price.Weekend and Monday Market PreviewWith no potential drivers to cause any significant spikes over the weekend, Bitcoin\u2019s safest zone is pegged above the $60,000 level. Currently, Bitcoin sits close to both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. Although a price correction is anticipated, its drop point is projected to be near the 20-day moving average, coinciding with the psychological level pegged at $60,000.Forecast Flash\u2023If BTCDom breaks above the 55.5% level and BTC successfully holds the $65,000 mark, a huge upside can be seen on Bitcoin\u2019s price."}]}

Recent AI integrations and strategic investments have boosted NEAR's price, indicating a bullish trend. These efforts suggest a promising upward trajectory, supported by rising on-chain volumes.Complementing this growth, Valour's launch of the first ETP for NEAR on Sweden's Spotlight Stock Market and Grayscale's inclusion of NEAR in its Decentralized AI Fund highlight NEAR's increasing appeal. These developments position NEAR for significant market gains, with increased global exposure and investor interest in its transformative DeFi and NFT platform.NEAR\u2019s Resilience and Market MomentumThis week's most important news for the crypto market and its impact on NEAR\u2019s price development were as follows:\u2023Grayscale\u2019s launch of its Decentralized AI Fund, which includes NEAR as its largest protocol in terms of market capitalization, highlights its pivotal role in the convergence of AI and blockchain technologies. The strategy for the new fund includes protocols that build decentralised AI services, solutions to problems related to centralised AI and protocols that build AI infrastructure.\u2023Building on this momentum, Valour has launched the first exchange-traded product (ETP) for NEAR on Sweden\u2019s Spotlight Stock Market, further boosting its prospects. This ETP provides investors access to NEAR\u2019s transformative DeFi and NFT platform.\u2023Additionally, NEAR has been one of the protocols that has best withstood the bearish period in the altcoin market over the last four months, after Bitcoin peaked in mid-March, posting two straight weeks of strong rebound since reaching the psychological $4 level in early July.Recent Price MovementsNEAR has had two consecutive weeks of strong upside after bouncing higher in the $4 area, strongly rejecting the reversal zone drawn from the October 2023 low to the 2024 high.It is currently testing the 0.38 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high, which could become a short-term price barrier. It remains to be seen if the price holds the current area and continues upwards towards $6.77 - $7.17 or if it retraces the gains of the last few weeks.Should it keep respecting the reversal zone starting at $4, this strength of the last few weeks could continue.Future PerspectivesThe entry given above at $5.68 is already in the profit zone, to re-enter should expect a pullback in price towards the $5.6 area or up to $4.94 and see how it behaves, whether or not it holds that area to re-enter the upside.Should the price continue to respect the $6.05 area, the price would have the upside probability on its side, and this could take it to the $6.77 area which is where the reversal zone traced from its last high begins. This reversal zone is an important test for the price of NEAR as if it is rejected, a bearish pattern could be triggered, which could cause the price to retrace the gains of the last few weeks.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesFantom (FTM)\u2023FTM has had a week of continuation of the downtrend it has been in since March 2024, retreating less than 2% and losing some of the value it had gained during the previous week. There is still no sign of bullish strength in FTM for a rebound.Kaspa (KAS):\u2023KAS has had, like NEAR, a positive week but has recently rejected the $0.18 area downwards which is where the reversal zone from its ATH begins. This is a cautionary signal as a test of this area with rejection could trigger a bearish pattern. In case it breaks $0.19 on the daily candlestick, it would be more likely to look for the ATH zone again or even surpass it."}]}

Concerns over weak real estate markets, especially in China, and potential corporate earnings disappointments in late 2024 have driven investors to seek safety in cash, hurting risk-on assets like Bitcoin.\u2023During this period, ATOM has managed to regain the $6.3 area, which was its previous historical support, in an agonising struggle to regain the level and not revisit price zones not seen since January 2021.Recent Price MovementsATOM has rejected the $5 price zone on the upside for two consecutive weeks, and recently just gained the $6.3 level again, which was its strongest historical support, so much so that it had not been breached forcefully since the lows of October 2023 and June 2022.Clearly, this was a dangerous signal for ATOM's price, but the good news is that in the second week after this breakout, ATOM regained this level and is currently close to closing the weekly candle above it, which would be a first positive sign for a short-term recovery.In case it manages to hold that level, obviously with the help of the market in general and mainly thinking in a Bitcoin price within the range above 60k, bounces could occur with a higher probability for ATOM.Future PerspectivesShould the $6.3 level be sustained, the likelihood of a bullish scenario would improve, which could lead the price to recover the subsequent Fibonacci levels traced from the last low near $5.To make an entry with a higher probability of success towards the $8.69 area, ideally the price should be expected to regain the $7.3 area, surpassing the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high and the last relative highs that currently act as a resistance for the ATOM price.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesPolkadot (DOT):\u2023DOT has had a week in which it has rejected the $6.56 price zone to the downside, which corresponds to the 0.23 Fibonacci level from its 2024 high. As long as it does not break $6.8 to the upside, its chances of remaining in the current range increase.Quant (QNT):\u2023QNT has rejected the level of its last relative high near $82, which currently constitutes a short-term bearish signal for its price. It should hold at $75 to continue to have a better chance of a rebound."}]}

It has risen roughly 30% after briefly dipping below the $55,000 mark, potentially shaking out retail investors and traders who expected another round of sell-offs. Currently, Joe Biden has withdrawn his presidential candidacy, but the market has not yet fully reacted to this news.Market Reacts to Biden's Withdrawal\u2023Joe Biden\u2019s Candidacy Withdrawal:U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race led to a sharp crypto dip followed by a near-immediate correction, causing significant liquidations. Nearly $67 million worth of leveraged long positions were liquidated from the cryptocurrency market within 30 minutes of Biden\u2019s announcement.Weekly Technical AnalysisBitcoin has finally reclaimed the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe, with the candles sitting above it after three weeks. Adding to this positive momentum is its successful reclamation of the $65,000 mark, a significant level for investors and traders as it aligns with the zone of the previous all-time high. However, the potential bearish divergence pattern in its relative strength index (RSI) is worth noting, which could lead to resistance near the $70,000 mark. Despite these market scenarios, Bitcoin is significantly removed from the danger zone, suggesting a stronger bullish sentiment in the long run.Daily Technical AnalysisBitcoin continues to show stronger moves during the weekend despite the idea of fewer trading participants, as the price successfully broke out and entered the middle range of the consolidation. The projected price correction did not occur last week but could potentially unfold this week. Here are three scenarios to anticipate:Price Correction:Bitcoin could retrace back to the middle line of the Darvas Box but will eventually challenge the previous all-time high resistance soon.Bullish Scenario:The price continues moving upward, either breaking the previous all-time high or encountering resistance near that level.Bearish Scenario:The price correction materializes, and Bitcoin sits close to the middle of the range. Subsequently, Bitcoin\u2019s $65,000 support might fail to hold, causing the price to drop to $56,500.Key Inflection Points\u2023Support:Bitcoin\u2019s is out of the danger zone and the 50-day moving average, which sits close to the middle line of the Darvas Box and also coincides with the psychological support at $65,000, should support to confirm a bullish sentiment in the long-term.\u2023Resistance:As Bitcoin enters the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box, the next immediate resistance is pegged at the previous all-time high - $73,800.Targets\u2023Bullish Targets:The nearest target for now is pegged at $73,800.\u2023Bearish Targets:Bitcoin\u2019s $63,800 should support, else, Bitcoin\u2019s price could drop near the $56,500."}]}

Since then, ETH's daily movement has been sluggish, with tighter volatility observed over the past seven days despite the recent news about Biden\u2019s presidential candidacy withdrawal. This price stability could be attributed to the recent announcement that the ETH ETF product will be available on five exchanges by the next trading day.Biden Exits, Ethereum ETFs Launch\u2023 Joe Biden\u2019s Candidacy Withdrawal:U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race led to a sharp crypto dip followed by a near-immediate correction, causing significant liquidations. Nearly $67 million worth of leveraged long positions were liquidated from the cryptocurrency market within 30 minutes of Biden\u2019s announcement.\u2023Ethereum\u2019s ETF to go live on Tuesday:The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has officially confirmed that five Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are set to debut on July 23.

This movement is also supported by the recent entry into the previous flip zone level, marking a historical and psychological value pegged at $3,500. Currently, the price hovers close to this level, potentially building a base in the middle of the wider range, signaling a potential rally ahead. Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) continues to stay above RSI50, indicating a bullish sentiment in the momentum.Daily Technical AnalysisEthereum has successfully breached the short-term trendline resistance on the daily timeframe, coinciding with a break above the 50-day moving average, leaving the candles sitting above all the moving averages. This market stance gives Ethereum investors the confidence needed before its next leg up, as it currently hovers close to the psychological support pegged at $3,500. While Ethereum continues its retest on the middle line of the range, two potential scenarios could unfold this week:\u2023 Bullish Scenario:Ethereum continues its upward movement to the $4,000 level before it starts correcting.\u2023 Bearish Scenario:Ethereum undergoes a breakdown structure, with the middle line of the Darvas Box support failing, including all moving averages breakdowns, leading ETH\u2019s price down to the $2,800 mark.Key Inflection Points\u2023 Supports:Ethereum to hold above the 100-day moving average or above $3,350 to confirm its bullish sentiment.\u2023 Resistance:Ethereum to challenge the recent high of the year pegged at $4,088 levels while it currently sits close to the support of the middle line of the range.What Are the Targets?\u2023 Bullish Targets:The nearest target for ETH is projected at $4,000.\u2023 Bearish Targets:If the price fails to stay inside the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box, ETH\u2019s price could drop to $2,800."}]}

As BTC continues to show strength, reclaiming the $65,000 mark and breaching the middle line of the Darvas Box, BTC.Dom has the potential to align with Bitcoin's upward movement, potentially entering the bullish side of the Darvas Box and moving towards the previous all-time high.DXYWhat is the recent behaviour and short-term outlook for DXY?The DXY (US Dollar Index) has rebounded on the trendline despite its recent breakdown over the last few days, suggesting a potential fake-out move by market makers. This indicates that the long-term trendline is still being respected and has the potential to rebound soon. However, DXY may face challenges bouncing back as all the moving averages could act as resistance along its course.S&P500How is the S&P500 currently performing and what does it imply?The S&P 500 has acted as an outlier, starting to correct while the rest of the markets move upward. Although a correction was due, its future movement could correlate with other markets once the dust finally settles.BTC.DomWhat is the future outlook for BTC.Dom?BTC Dominance (BTCDom) has finally emerged from its four-week consolidation range but remains within the bearish trajectory.

If any catastrophic events occur, BTC could drop below the $60,000 mark or even down to the low of the range pegged at $56,500. If this setup materializes, the risk-to-reward ratio for this play is highly favourable, with an estimated ratio of approximately 1:5.\u2023Bullish:While Bitcoin's strength over the past few days continues to grow as it breaches above two moving averages, the price is nearing a potential correction, likely retesting close to the $65,000 mark. The projected rebound price is at the 100-day moving average, coinciding with the middle line of the Darvas Box. This setup offers a 1:3 risk-to-reward ratio, with potential bonuses if BTC makes another record high.Connecting the DotsWhat is the overall market outlook?With the recent events surrounding the US election campaign, including a failed assassination attempt and President Biden's withdrawal from the race, the markets could be navigating uncharted waters. Earlier today, during the announcement of Biden\u2019s withdrawal, the crypto markets did not react wildly, with BTC remaining close to yesterday\u2019s price. Although there were liquidations recorded, they were not as alarming as previous sell-offs over the past few months. This could suggest a stronger crypto market ahead, given Bitcoin Dominance\u2019s (BTC.Dom) position as it potentially enters the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box while currently challenging the 55.5% mark.Meanwhile, the DXY has shifted its trend, with last week's breakdown move proving to be a fake-out, causing the DXY to bounce at the trendline.

While the general market builds strength, including Bitcoin breaking above the $65,000 mark, ADA struggles to establish another higher-high structure. Following Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the candidacy, the crypto markets reacted healthily, with ADA maintaining its position above the $0.40 mark, suggesting that another potential leg up is imminent.Cardano's Node 9.0 and Biden's Impact\u2023 Joe Biden\u2019s Candidacy Withdrawal:U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race led to a sharp crypto dip followed by a near-immediate correction, causing significant liquidations. Nearly $67 million worth of leveraged long positions were liquidated from the cryptocurrency market within 30 minutes of Biden\u2019s announcement.\u2023 Node 9.0:Cardano released Node 9.0 on July 8, marking the first step toward fully decentralised governance. The Chang Hardfork is a two-part Hardfork Combinator Event that Cardano will undergo this year to transition to full decentralised governance as outlined in CIP-1694. This significant milestone, announced by Charles Hoskinson on July 9th, 2024, with the release of Cardano Node 9.0.0, marks the first steps toward activating Minimal Viable Governance. This node contains all the necessary changes for the Conway Ledger Era. Here are the key improvements:Decentralized Governance:Empowers ADA holders and stake pool operators (SPOs) with direct decision-making power.On-Chain Voting:Introduces on-chain voting for transparency and direct stakeholder involvement.Delegated Representatives (DReps):Community-elected representatives who vote on proposals and influence Cardano's direction.Treasury System:Establishes a treasury to fund community-proposed projects, voted on by ADA holders.PlutusV3 Ledger Language:Enhances smart contract capabilities, enabling more complex dApps.Constitution and Committee:Guides governance with a constitution and a committee to ensure proposals align with ecosystem values.Community-Driven Development:Shifts towards a model where the community shapes Cardano\u2019s future.Increased Security and Efficiency:Boosts security and scalability, making Cardano more robust.Weekly Technical AnalysisOver the past few weeks, ADA's continued price decline has ended despite breaching the structural support at the $0.40 level. The breakdown was considered an overshoot by sellers, forming a classic fake-out pattern by market makers targeting stop losses among traders and investors. Recently, its weekly candle successfully breached the 100-day moving average, suggesting a potential shift in the trend and setting up a swing opportunity for mid-term holders. However, the relative strength index (RSI) remains below 50, indicating that a longer holding period might be necessary as bearish momentum persists.Daily Technical AnalysisThe projected bullish setup from last week has yet to be fulfilled, as ADA\u2019s price struggles to breach the $0.45 mark and has been in a narrow consolidation over the past 10 days. The 100-day moving average also coincides with this hindrance, acting as resistance and keeping the candles hovering close to it. As ADA continues to build another base right below the middle line of the Darvas Box, two potential scenarios can unfold this week:Bullish Scenario:ADA successfully enters the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box, potentially moving towards the $0.50 mark with the moving averages transitioning to a trend-following setup.Bearish Scenario:A price correction occurs, with the 100-day moving average acting as immediate resistance, potentially causing the price to drop to the $0.35 mark.Key Inflection Points\u2023 Supports:ADA needs to stay on top of the 20-day and 50-day moving averages on the daily timeframe to confirm a trend-following setup.\u2023 Resistance:A break above the 100-day moving average of the daily timeframe or the $0.45 mark confirms another higher-high structure.What Are the Bullish and Bearish Targets?\u2023 Bullish Targets:As the price nears breaking above the middle line of the range, the next target price is set to $0.52 mark.\u2023 Bearish Targets:The nearest bearish target is set at $0.35."}]}

This increase is a response to improved governance measures aimed at enhancing decentralization and stakeholder involvement within the ecosystem. The update was introduced by the NEAR Foundation in collaboration with Gauntlet. This proposal aims to enhance the decentralization, accountability, and performance of the NEAR ecosystem. It includes measures such as forming a Screening Committee to manage the selection of delegates and prescreen grant proposals, as well as introducing an Endorsed Delegate Mechanism to describe the functions and procedures of delegates crucial for operational governance, also a new funding mechanism to ensure long-term commitment and strengthen the ecosystem. The market\u2019s positive reaction reflects strong investor confidence in NEAR\u2019s strategic direction and its potential for continued growth.Weekly Technical AnalysisNEAR\u2019s weekly timeframe strongly suggests a bearish sentiment as the price appears due for a correction anytime soon.

The next potential resistance is pegged at the psychological value of $6.5, where the middle line of the Darvas Box also sits. These market scenarios make NEAR\u2019s attempt to break above the middle of the range very challenging at the moment.Daily Technical\u00a0 AnalysisFollowing the past few weeks' short-term rally, with NEAR moving from $4 to $6.4, its recent daily price action struggles to breach the 100-day moving average, remaining below it for the last 8 days. This failed attempt is also supported by resistance in its relative strength index (RSI), with overbought levels starting to resist and leaving the RSI below 70. Despite the price\u2019s shifting market structure, two potential scenarios could unfold over the next few days:Bullish Scenario:The price needs to break above the 100-day moving average at $6.34 to confirm a continuation of the bullish sentiment.Bearish Scenario:If the 100-day moving average continues to act as resistance, it could drive the price downwards, potentially rejecting it back to $4.00.Key Inflection Points\u2023 Supports:Both the 20-day and 50-day moving averages need to hold the candles above to confirm a bullish structural trend following setup.\u2023 Resistance:The 100-day moving average is the immediate support seen over the last few days.What Are the Bullish and Bearish Targets?\u2023 Bullish Targets:If the $7.00 breakout happens soon, the $9.00 mark could be the next take profit target.\u2023 Bearish Targets:NEAR can drop to as low as $4.00 if the market sentiment shifts to bearish."}]}

However, following closely behind is a potential swing setup for position traders as the previous price declines could indicate an overshoot movement below the support levels, causing a fake-out pattern to emerge recently. With ETF Spot highlighting the recent market activity, this gives a green light to participants who are afraid to invest in cryptos, as ETFs provide a safer and more secure way for investors to gain exposure to the crypto markets.ETH ETFs Soar, Biden Withdrawal Shocks\u2023 ETH ETF SPOT:Ethereum\u2019s Spot ETFs officially started trading yesterday, July 23, 2024, with a soaring $361 million volume in the first 90 minutes. This creates an impact on the overall market sentiment as this marks the second crypto-based ETF.\u2023 Joe Biden\u2019s Candidacy Withdrawal:U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race led to a sharp crypto dip followed by a near-immediate correction, causing significant liquidations. Nearly $67 million worth of leveraged long positions were liquidated from the cryptocurrency market within 30 minutes of Biden\u2019s announcement.Weekly Technical AnalysisFantom\u2019s (FTM) current weekly price action confirms a price correction stage after following a strong close over the past two weeks. Although it is still under a one-candle consolidation following the July 2024 sell-off, it is situated above the 50-day moving average, which acts as its mid-term support. Its relative strength index also coincides with the price rejection as it struggles to enter above RSI50. However, as the price consolidates higher than the previous range area, it could suggest another preparatory stage before its next upward movement.Daily Technical AnalysisFollowing last week\u2019s price action, FTM has not successfully breached the market structure, causing FTM\u2019s price to consolidate above the 20-day moving average. The failed attempt was potentially caused by the 50-day moving average as it resisted the candles breaching above it. Momentarily, FTM is retesting the 20-day moving average as support and could follow two potential scenarios:\u2023 Bullish Scenario:If the 20-day moving average successfully holds and supports the price, FTM could move towards the $0.70 level.\u2023 Bearish Scenario:If the 20-day moving average fails to hold, with a shift in market sentiment, FTM\u2019s price could drop to the $0.30 mark.Key Inflection Points\u2023 Supports:The 20-day moving average of the daily timeframe should act as its immediate support after a recent break above it. The recent price correction should be considered a retest to confirm its next leg up.\u2023 Resistance:$0.60 is still the next immediate resistance, considering this is a whole number resistance and coincides with the market structure resistance.Targets\u2023 Bullish Targets:A swing target is locked at the $0.70 level where the 100-day moving average closely hovers.\u2023 Bearish Targets:The $0.30 mark can be declared as its closest target price for shorting."}]}

The breakout attempt was robust, breaching multiple resistances. This is heavily backed by the general market sentiment, as Bitcoin successfully held the $65,000 level, which is significant for long-term holders. Another factor contributing to SOL\u2019s performance is investor confidence, as Solana holds the sell-offs despite rumours about whales withdrawing SOL tokens, anticipating selling pressure on the coin. The native token of the Solana chain held on to its recent gains despite the looming fear of a sell-off.Solana Whales Stake, ETFs on Horizon\u2023 Solana ETF Outlook:Franklin Templeton, a pioneer in launching spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., is now expressing enthusiasm about the potential for other cryptocurrencies, like Solana, to support new ETF offerings.\u2023 Solana Whale Interest:Whales withdrew $41.4M worth of SOL from Binance in two days. After withdrawal, the SOL tokens were staked, suggesting that these investors are interested in the Solana network for the long term. This entails providing a certain quantity of a digital currency for performing certain functions for blockchain functionality in exchange for gains.Weekly Technical AnalysisSolana\u2019s weekly candle closed with a bang, breaching multiple resistances, including the 20-day moving average, the short-term trendline resistance, and the middle line of the Darvas Box. This market scenario confirms a solid bullish engulfing candle, suggesting strong momentum ahead, which could add more confidence to traders and investors. Also worth considering is its relative strength index, as it enters above RSI60, suggesting more bullishness than last week\u2019s RSI status.Daily Technical AnalysisSolana (SOL) had a very strong move last Friday after it successfully broke the middle line of its range and coincided with the breach above the trendline resistance, confirming it is out of the bearish trend. This is backed by all moving averages below the candles acting as support while it consolidated for a while before making its bold move into the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box. Presently, SOL could unfold two potential scenarios this week:Bullish Scenario:The recent price correction is about to end, and SOL could start moving towards the $200 mark, potentially making another record high for this year.Bearish Scenario:This bearish scenario is unlikely to happen, but if the general sentiment shifts, SOL\u2019s price could drop below $100.Inflection Points\u2023\u00a0 Supports:As SOL successfully breaches all the moving averages, including the middle line of the Darvas Box, it needs to support the $150 mark to confirm a higher-low structure before its next potential rally.\u2023\u00a0 Resistance:The closest resistance level is pegged at the Darvas Box top or near the $200 mark.Targets\u2023 Bullish Targets:The $200 mark can be the easiest target for long setups at the moment.\u2023 Bearish Targets:If the $165 mark fails to support, SOL can drop to $125."}]}

This price correction coincided with its momentum indicator, the relative strength index, which resisted breaking out above the overbought levels. Despite being backed by recent partnerships and developments of AVAX, its price has strived to stay above the $30 mark over the last 38 days. Although it had breached above it earlier this week, as the general market started to correct, AVAX's price dropped below the psychological value again.How Are New Partnerships Impacting Avalanche?\u2023 Continued Partnerships:ChronosWorlds:Last week, ChronosWorlds, a post-apocalyptic RPG game, tweeted, \"Avalanche is the chain for gaming.\" They announced a partnership with Avalanche as a preferred deployment chain, highlighting the growing interest in utilizing a robust and stable blockchain platform.Stripe: Avalanche has partnered with Stripe to enhance its ecosystem accessibility. This strategic collaboration integrates Stripe\u2019s fiat-to-crypto on-ramping capabilities directly with Avalanche\u2019s C-Chain, allowing retail users to purchase AVAX without navigating the complexities of traditional crypto exchanges.Weekly Chart: Will AVAX's Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern Hold?The classic \"inverse head and shoulders\" pattern identified over the past few weeks is still at play, with a target set high and a risk-to-reward ratio of 1:4. This means that a longer holding period should be expected by traders and investors, given that market sentiment often shifts. This is also backed by the 50-day moving average acting as resistance on the candles, as it has been hovering around it over the past 6 weeks. This is also in confluence with a psychological value pegged at $30, where the coin continuously struggles to breach.Daily Chart: Will AVAX Break Above $30 or Fall?AVAX\u2019s attempt to break above the 100-day moving average was unsustained, leaving the price to fall below the $30 mark. This price level has been very challenging as it acted as the flip zone level, support turned into resistance, and coincided with a psychological value. However, AVAX is currently situated at multiple support confluences, including a new trendline with the 20-day moving average hovering near it. While AVAX remains resilient in its attempt to break above the $30.00 mark soon, two scenarios could unfold this week:\u2023Bullish Scenario:As AVAX breached the $30 mark last week, another breakout attempt could occur soon, with confluence to breaking above the 100-day moving average confirming a higher-high structure on the daily timeframe.\u2023Bearish Scenario:If the 20-day moving average and the trendline fail to hold, with a general market sentiment shift, the price could drop to $22.00.Key Points to Watch\u2023Supports:As AVAX continues its price correction, the $25 mark needs to hold in order to confirm a higher-low structure.\u2023Resistance:AVAX needs to stay above the 100-day moving average on the daily timeframe to confirm the start of a trend-following setup.Targets\u2023Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $30, the $37.20 price could be the next target.\u2023Bearish Targets:As AVAX continues its struggle to break above the $30 mark, if the general market continues to correct over the next few days, the price could drop to $22."}]}

Among the Layer 1 protocols,NEAR and FTMsaw notabledeclinesof8.08%and7.07%respectively.Kaspa (KAS)stood out with arelatively minor decline of 1.46%.Theprice movements of NEAR and FTM are more aligned with ETH, showing significant declines.KAS, however,showed a divergencewith a much smaller decline, indicating apotential decoupling from the general trendobserved in the L1s and ETH.Why Did Ethereum's Value Drop Recently?Ethereum's recent decreasein market value can be attributed to themixed reception of newly launched Ethereum ETFs. While theinitial day saw substantial inflowstotaling over $106 million, thesubsequent day witnessed significant outflows, particularly from Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust, resulting in a net withdrawal of $133.3 million. Thisvolatility reflects investor uncertainty and the high sensitivity of ETH\u2019s priceto market movements, as noted by analysts. Additionally, despite the promising potential of these ETFs to attract institutional interest and drive long-term growth, theimmediate impact was a sharp decline in ETH\u2019s price, exacerbated by larger-than-expected withdrawals and a weaker-than-anticipated demand.What is the Reason behind Near and Fantom\u2019s decrease?One one hand,Near Protocolhas recently experienced asignificant declinein its price,similar to Ethereum's downward trend. Over the past week,NEAR's valuefell to aseven-day low, triggering a surge in long liquidationsin its futures market as traders were forced to close their positions due to the persistent price drop. Thisdownward trajectory has been compounded by broader market sentimentsthat have negatively affected many cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.Despite the promising news of NEAR achieving a real-world assets (RWA) milestone through the launch of the first exchange-traded product (ETP)supported by NEAR Protocol, the overall bearish market sentiment has overshadowed this positive development.On the other hand,Fantom (FTM)has also experienced asignificant declineover the past week,despite promising developments such as partnerships with Alchemy and Sonic Labs to enhance the Opera network's scalability and security. Thebroader bearish market sentiment has undoubtedly played a role in this drop, but internal factors like thecomplexities and uncertainties surrounding the relaunch of its native stablecoin, fUSD, have also contributed. While this relaunch aims to boost Fantom's DeFi capabilities, the liquidation of positions and restructuring processes have likelyfueled short-term investor apprehensions.Additionally, theannouncement of a 370 million FTM incentive program to attract developers and liquidity highlights Fantom's aggressive growth strategy, which, while promising for long-term prospects, can introducevolatility in the short term. These combined factors have resulted in the notable price decrease for FTM.What Influenced Kaspa's Smallest Fall?Finally,Kaspa (KAS)has experienced arelatively minor decline, demonstrating resilience compared to other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Near Protocol. Thisstability can be attributed to several positive developments within the Kaspa ecosystem. Despite the broader market's bearish trend, Kaspa has seen asignificant increase in its network hashrate, reflecting substantial investment and confidence in its mining operations. Additionally, therecent launch of the Kaspa Industrial Initiative Foundation (KII) by Dii Desert Energy, aimed at integrating Kaspa into various sectors and enhancing its scalability and transaction speed, has bolstered investor confidence."}]}

The recent partnership updates and the growing mining hype, particularly driven by Marathon Digital Holdings, have significantly bolstered its price stability. Despite the large liquidation numbers from today\u2019s sell-off, KASPA maintains its upward momentum, unaffected by broader market downturns, and is considered one of the outliers in the recent market conditions.What Recent Developments Are Boosting KASPA?\u2023 Mining Operations Expansion:Marathon Digital Holdings has expanded its mining operations to include Kaspa, accumulating significant amounts of KAS and highlighting the cryptocurrency\u2019s growing appeal among institutional miners.\u2023 Strategic Partnership Announcement:Dii Desert Energy has launched the Kaspa KII Foundation to boost the integration of the Kaspa cryptocurrency in various sectors. This initiative aims to leverage Kaspa's scalability and high-speed transaction capabilities to revolutionize finance, energy, and more. This partnership could significantly expand Kaspa's ecosystem and adoption.Weekly Chart: Is KASPA Preparing for Its Next Big Move?The classic cup and handle pattern is still at play, with the recent price action maintaining a bullish trajectory within the Darvas Box. As the general market anticipated the recent price correction, KASPA\u2019s price action remains resilient, holding low volatility over the last few days and avoiding potential shakeouts of holders. This consolidation suggests a potential preparation for its next big move, as it is less than 10% away from making another all-time high.Daily Chart: Will KASPA's Consolidation Lead to a Breakout?KASPA is under a micro Darvas Box consolidation with a range of roughly 6% over the last 10 days as the market enters a correction phase. This is heavily supported by the 20-day moving average, which has historically trailed along the price movement. Despite the general market starting to experience a price correction, two potential scenarios could unfold this week:Bullish Scenario:KASPA has been trailing along the 20-day moving average on the daily timeframe. This is the immediate support it needs to hold to confirm the bullish setup and materialize over the next few days.Bearish Scenario:If the 20-day moving average fails to hold and the price falls below the range low pegged at $0.17, it could drop to the middle of the range or near the $0.14 level.Key Inflection Points\u2023Supports: KAS is under a narrow one-candle consolidation, with the range low pegged at $0.17. This price level should hold, with the 50-day moving average following behind to act as additional support.\u2023Resistance: KAS is close to challenging the previous all-time high key level pegged at $0.1913.Targets\u2023Bullish Targets:The realistic target with an acceptable waiting period is drawn at a Fibonacci level pegged at $0.2452, as no resistance can be plotted due to the potential for another all-time high.\u2023Bearish Targets:A break below the 100-day moving average or below $0.1473 could potentially lead the price down to $0.113."}]}

This drop caused fear in the general market, leading to a significant number of liquidations. However, during Thursday\u2019s closing, Bitcoin recovered and closed above $66,000, forming a hammer candle that suggests a classic sign of reversal as the bulls dominated the trading day by pushing the price back up. This recovery could potentially be backed by the recent announcement from Senator Cynthia Lummis regarding her plans to introduce legislation for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This legislation, which could be unveiled as early as this weekend, is part of a broader push to recognize Bitcoin as a strategic asset and could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency's role in the economy and its institutional adoption. The proposal could stir controversy over Bitcoin\u2019s impact on gold\u2019s value and the Fed\u2019s ability to use Bitcoin as an economic hedge.Is Bitcoin's Hammer Candle a Sign of Bullish Momentum?\u2023 Bitcoin recovered swiftly after breaching below $65,000, forming a hammer candle that signals another potential rally. This rebound solidifies BTC's position above the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe, indicating sustained bullish momentum. However, caution is warranted as BTC's RSI remains under a bearish divergence setup, suggesting potential underlying weakness. Despite this, the recent price action demonstrates resilience and hints at further upward movement.\u2023 Bitcoin bounced off the middle line of the Darvas Box, aligning perfectly with the key level of the previous all-time high pegged at $65,000. This crucial $65,000 mark not only signifies a technical confluence but also holds significant psychological value for BTC holders. The rebound at this level underscores the strength of investor sentiment and the market's resilience. As Bitcoin maintains its stance above this pivotal threshold, it signals a potential for further upward movement.Will BTC.Dom Continue to Surge in the Coming Days1.\tBitcoin\u2019s Strength:Bitcoin\u2019s attempt to break above the $66,000 mark on a Sunday indicates its continued strength, sustaining the break above the middle line of the Darvas Box over the weekend and leading to the recent price of $68,400. Despite its price correction that started 3 days ago, Bitcoin has already retested the middle line of its range supported by two moving averages acting as support and the recent announcement of a Bitcoin Reserve Bill, leaving Bitcoin to potentially start another round of rally towards the recent all-time high price pegged at $73,800.2.\tBitcoin Dominance:Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.Dom) has kept its strength since the start of the week as it successfully entered the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box. Yesterday, Bitcoin Dominance closed strongly, breaking above its 3-month consolidation pattern, suggesting a continuation of a long-term turnaround phase and Bitcoin to be more dominant over the next few days.3. Potential Bearish Scenario:If the $63,300 mark fails to support, backed heavily by 3 moving averages on the daily timeframe, Bitcoin\u2019s price could plunge below the $60,000 mark, causing fear among general market participants. In such a case, Bitcoin could nosedive and experience significant losses as there are no other anticipated catalysts over the next few months.Snapshot\u2023 Bitcoin\u2019s recent price action is just a price correction after a strong short-term rally from $53,500 to $68,400 in 16 days.\u2023 BTC.Dom has successfully broken above the 3-month consolidation period and could start another higher-high consolidation level.\u2023 Bitcoin\u2019s weekly trail still respects the 20-day moving average after it successfully entered above it.Will Low Volatility Push Bitcoin to New Highs?As BTC.Dom stays above the 56% rate and with no potential drivers to cause any significant spikes over the weekend, Bitcoin could slowly move towards $70,000 without higher volatility. Currently, Bitcoin sits close to the middle of the range after its retest and is backed by both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. This scenario could indicate a swing high setup towards BTC\u2019s all-time high price.Forecast Flash\u2023 If BTC.Dom breaks below the 56% level but BTC holds the $65,000 mark, BTC could remain sluggish over a short period of time."}]}

This could be the potential reason for Bitcoin Dominance's clear breakout and Bitcoin\u2019s recent short-term rally close to the $70,000 mark.Meanwhile, the DXY has remained sideways but hovered near the historical trendline support while waiting for the FED interest rate decisions this week.

Although historical price action indicates that the long-term trendline is still being respected and has the potential to rebound soon, it should have already rebounded.

However, a correction is to be expected after every successful breakout to confirm another leg-up structure. This would coincide with the FED\u2019s interest rate decision happening this week.

This historical resistance remains unbreached, causing the price to hover just below this key level. The price continues to linger near the 20-day moving average on the weekly chart but has now slipped below it. This scenario indicates a consolidation phase, with Ethereum struggling to gain the necessary momentum to push through the formidable $3,500 resistance.What Recent Updates Are Affecting Ethereum\u2019s Price?\u2023 Ethereum\u2019s Pectra:The Ethereum community is eagerly anticipating the launch of Pectra, the next significant hard fork for Ethereum, expected in late Q4 2024.

Key updates include increased validator stake limits, flexible staking withdrawals, and streamlined smart contract deployment, all contributing to enhanced network efficiency and security.\u2023 What to Expect from Pectra\u2019s Upgrade:Ethereum\u2019s recent price action suggests a longer consolidation period. With the anticipated Pectra Upgrade occurring in Q4 2024, Ethereum\u2019s price should be above $4,000 by then. This would mean Ethereum is out of its recent consolidation range of $2,800 to $4,100.

The RSI has bounced back to the middle line, indicating a recovery in momentum. However, caution is warranted as the RSI still exhibits a potential bearish divergence setup. This divergence suggests underlying weakness despite the current upward movement, making this week pivotal for confirming the breakout or signaling a potential reversal, especially considering the market\u2019s volatility ahead of the FED\u2019s interest rate decision.What Potential Moves to Expect Over the Next Few Days?Ethereum has failed to hold the significant $3,500 mark, with the price dropping last week, confirming a failed breakout attempt to enter the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box. However, the drop is seen as a retest, with the previous trendline resistance now acting as potential support while the price consolidates above it. While Ethereum continues its retest on the trendline, two potential scenarios could unfold this week:Bullish Scenario: The trendline continues to support the price, helping it move towards the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box. It may take some time to consolidate before ETH moves towards the $4,000 level.Bearish Scenario: The $3,500 level rejects the price, causing ETH to plunge to $2,800.Key Inflection Points\u2023 Supports: The trendline should hold and coincide with the psychological value at $3,000 to confirm a bullish stance for Ethereum.\u2023 Resistance: Ethereum continues to struggle to stay above the $3,500 mark, which is considered to be its immediate resistance.What Are the Targets?\u2023 Bullish Targets: The nearest target for ETH is projected at $4,000.\u2023 Bearish Targets: If the price fails to stay inside the bullish trajectory of the Darvas Box, ETH\u2019s price could drop to $2,800."}]}

In addition, BTC.D remains close to key resistance which, if overcome, could lead to further declines in altcoins.Finally, TOTAL3 has encountered strong resistance at 640B and is at the upper edge of its bearish channel, so further declines could be expected.The overall scenario remains unfavourable for a price rise in altcoins.Cosmos Hub:What\u2019s the Outlook for ATOM?ATOM is in a downward trend and currently showing weakness. Should it fail to hold the $5 area, it could fall towards $3.88 - $3.38 and even close to its ATL. Should it hold $6.3, the likelihood of a rebound to the upper end of the downtrend could increase.Polkadot:How is DOT Performing Now and where it could be heading?The price zone between $5.36 and $6.78 will be key for the market to define whether DOT will continue down towards $5.13 - $4.4 or if it will finally reject the reversal zone of the October 2023 low and head towards the green targets on the chart.Quant Network:What's Next for QNT After Recent Movements?QNT has shown strong weakness recently, and breaking the $69 support could lead to $65 - $58 - $52. In case of breaking the $81-$85 resistance, the stock could head towards $97 and higher targets with a higher probability of occurrence.BTC.DomBTC.D continues to reject the 56.5% downside zone at present, but is still, within the long-term ascending channel it has been describing. Until it breaks above that level or falls below 54%, There probably won't be any major moves in the altcoin market.TOTAL 3TOTAL3 continues to reject downwards the 640B zone.

Despite a recent partnership with California\u2019s DMV to digitize car titles, AVAX has not yet shown a bold move or a short-term spike in daily price movement. However, this collaboration is expected to increase exposure to Avalanche\u2019s ecosystem, as users holding digital car title tokens will use an app that includes the Avalanche wallet, making them familiar with crypto wallets, according to Mark Cuban.What Else Should We Know About This Partnership?\u2023 The California DMV has digitized 42 million car titles on the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain, marking a significant milestone in modernizing public records and enhancing efficiency.\u2023 The partnership between the California DMV, Oxhead Alpha, and Avalanche aims to streamline vehicle title transfers, reducing the time needed for the process from weeks to just minutes.\u2023 By digitizing titles and making them accessible through a secure mobile wallet app, the DMV expects to reduce the need for physical trips to its offices, thereby improving efficiency and convenience for residents.\u2023 The use of blockchain technology is expected to enhance the security and transparency of the title transfer process, reducing the potential for fraud and improving the overall safety of the system.\u2023 Also, the initiative is part of a broader plan by California to integrate blockchain solutions into government operations, aiming to improve efficiency and accessibility within public sectors.\u2023 This partnership is one of the first implementations of the state's plan to integrate blockchain solutions into government operations, setting a precedent for other jurisdictions to follow suit.What\u2019s the mid-term outlook for AVAX?Over the past few weeks, a classic \"inverse head and shoulders\" pattern has been identified. However, this pattern started showing signs of invalidation as the price failed to sustain its upward trend and breach the $30 mark. An attempt to break above this level was recorded but was unsustained due to potential resistance on the weekly timeframe at the 50-day moving average. The rejection also coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) failing to break above RSI50 or enter a bullish trajectory. Currently, AVAX is back in a narrow one-candle consolidation ranging from $24.13 to $30.32.What's AVAX's Short-Term Potential?AVAX\u2019s attempt to break above the 100-day moving average was unsustained, coinciding with the RSI's failure to break above overbought levels. This left the price below the $30 mark, currently trading near $25. As AVAX continues its price correction, two scenarios could unfold this week:Bullish Scenario:AVAX could bounce back strongly to the $30 level despite its extended price correction. A move towards $30 would be robust, breaking multiple indicators including all the moving averages.Bearish Scenario:The price may extend its downward movement, causing AVAX to fall to $20.Key Points to Watch\u2023 Supports:The $25 mark needs to hold to confirm a higher-low structure as AVAX continues its price correction.\u2023 Resistance:AVAX needs to stay above the 100-day moving average, pegged at $31.41 on the daily timeframe, to confirm a shift in momentum.Targets\u2023 Bullish Targets:Once the price breaks above $30, the next target could be $37.20.\u2023 Bearish Targets:If AVAX continues to struggle to break above $30 and the general market corrects over the next few days, the price could drop to $20."}]}

This rejection affected most altcoins, except for KASPA, which remains an outlier in this type of market environment. Despite the general market experiencing a price correction, KASPA demonstrated remarkable resilience by breaking out of its 6-month consolidation and recording a new all-time high price. KASPA has slowly entered the $0.20 level following recent macroeconomic data as the FED kept the interest rate flat, although it has not yet exploded.What Significant Data Could Affect KAS\u2019 Price Action?\u2023 Bitcoin Conference 2024:Former President Donald Trump made several bullish statements at the conference, including promises to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, halt U.S. Bitcoin sales to create a strategic reserve, and end anti-crypto policies if elected. These promises to support Bitcoin and crypto could lead to increased adoption and positive sentiment in the market.\u2023 FED Rate Cut Decision:The Federal Reserve kept interest rates at a two-decade high on Wednesday, while leaving the door open for rate cuts as soon as its next meeting in September. A potential FED rate cut in September could lead to increased liquidity and investment in the crypto market, including KAS. However, the Fed's rate cut decision is uncertain, and the market may react negatively if it is not forthcoming or delayed, the impact against these scenarios could be strong as discounts for possible rate cuts in September are already being applied by the market.How is the weekly timeframe outlook?Earlier this week, KASPA showed signs of potentially breaking above the weekly key level as Monday\u2019s closing price ended at $0.1941, just roughly 1.5% away from the all-time high. Yesterday, despite the FED\u2019s decision regarding the interest rate, KASPA showed strength by breaking above the $0.20 level, marking another all-time high. Historically, KASPA\u2019s price spikes and goes parabolic when its RSI reaches above RSI70. Currently, KASPA could slowly move upward as its RSI maintains below the overbought levels, indicating a healthy and steady trend.What\u2019s the short-term outlook for KASPA?KASPA\u2019s daily price action could potentially confirm the start of a parabolic move as it showed a clear breakout yesterday and its RSI broke above the overbought levels. However, the general market continues to stay weak, which could affect KASPA\u2019s momentum this week. The following scenarios could unfold this week:Bullish Scenario: KASPA continues moving towards the $0.25 level, tagged as the nearest resistance price based on an extended Fibonacci level (1.618).Pullback Scenario: KASPA retests its previous breakout zone at $0.1930 before making another move towards $0.25.Bearish Scenario: KASPA might create a false breakout pattern, making a bull trap, and falling back inside the range or below the $0.19 level.Key Inflection Points\u2023 Supports:KASPA\u2019s $0.1930 level should hold; otherwise, the price could fall to $0.1450.\u2023 Resistance:KASPA does not have any historical price resistance as it created a new all-time high. However, the nearest price target is pegged at $0.25, derived from a certain Fibonacci level.Target Levels\u2023 Bullish Targets:The short-term target for longs is pegged at $0.25.\u2023 Bearish Targets:KASPA\u2019s price could fall to $0.145 if the breakout is unsustained."}]}

Donald Trump outlined his plans to make the United States the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and a \"Bitcoin superpower,\" but the market has reacted negatively. This price movement is heavily influenced by a week full of macroeconomic data releases, including the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates flat and the uncertainty of rate cuts in September. Currently, Bitcoin stumbles below multiple support structures, such as the 20-day moving average on the weekly timeframe, and has broken below the middle line of the larger range, suggesting a potential bearish sentiment over the next few weeks.What is the significant data affecting Bitcoin\u2019s movement?Bitcoin Conference 2024:The recent statements by Donald Trump at the conference could be seen as a significant positive catalyst for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. Trump's promises to stop the U.S. from selling Bitcoin and to create a strategic reserve of the cryptocurrency, if elected, could be interpreted as a form of endorsement and support for BTC.Flat Interest Rate:The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates flat is also a factor to consider. Historically, when interest rates are low, investors tend to seek higher returns in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. However, the market's bearish reaction to this news suggests that other factors might be at play. The market may be reacting to the uncertainty surrounding the Fed's future monetary policy decisions.UK Interest Rates:The UK's recent interest rate cut could also have an impact on Bitcoin's price. Lower interest rates in the UK could lead to increased investment in Bitcoin, as investors look for higher returns in a low-yield environment. Additionally, the availability of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs worldwide could facilitate this investment.What is the weekly outlook for BITCOIN?Bitcoin recently attempted to break above the $70,000 mark, but the momentum proved unsustainable, leading to a plunge below $65,000. The 20-day moving average failed to provide support, coinciding with a break below the middle line of the range, suggesting a bearish trajectory and consolidation phase. The bearish divergence pattern in its RSI has been continuously respected, reinforcing the downward pressure and signaling a need for caution among traders as Bitcoin navigates this corrective phase.What is the expectation over the next few days?Bitcoin has now entered the bearish trajectory of its wider consolidation range as the price drops below the $65,000 mark. While Bitcoin continues its price correction movement, here are two potential scenarios to anticipate:Bullish Scenario:Bitcoin will bounce back with the 50-day moving average following behind it and head back above the $65,000 mark.Bearish Scenario:Bitcoin continues to drop and might break below $60,000, which could cause fear, leading BTC to fall to $56,000.Key Inflection Points\u2023 Support:The 50-day moving average on the daily timeframe should provide support; otherwise, the $60,000 level could be revisited.\u2023 Resistance:Bitcoin needs to break above the $65,000 mark to confirm its distance away from the danger zone pegged at $60,000.Targets\u2023 Bullish Targets:The nearest target for now is pegged at $73,800.\u2023 Bearish Targets:Bitcoin could drop to $60,000 if it fails to break above the previous all-time high."}]}

While thelaunch of Node 9.1.0 is a critical step, the full benefits of the upgrade are yet to be realised, unlike previous upgrades such as the Alonzo Hard Fork, which had a swift positive impact on ADA\u2019s price.

However, Bitcoin\u2019s price corrected and plunged below the $65,000 mark after the Fed's rate cut decision.

This demonstrates the potential of KAS to diversify the Bitcoin portfolio, which could also attract institutional interest. Also, the price of KAS has risen more than 26% since Marathon Digital's announcement, reaching new all-time highs twice.What has happened with Kaspa these past months?This week's most important news for the crypto market and its impact on KAS\u2019s price development were as follows:\u2023 This week Donald Trump gave a strongly pro-crypto speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, which caused the price to continue to rise over the weekend of 27 July, reaching a high of $69,400 and pushing the price to touch 70k on Monday 29th and having a positive impact on KAS, which only on Thursday 1st August showed signs of slight weakness, falling back less than 2%.\u2023 The launch of the Ethereum ETF did not seem to have generated the expected impact on its price nor had much effect on the rest of the cryptocurrencies in the short term, and apparently behaved as a \"Sell the news\" event.\u2023 Kaspa has also demonstrated its potential for growth in the market, backed by Marathon Digital's announcement of a $16 million investment in ASIC miners with a capacity of 60 petahash. As of June 2024, 93 million tokens have been mined and are currently worth $18 million. This would demonstrate Kaspa's mining efficiency and the network's growth potential, as well as its price potential.\u2023 The price of KAS has again reached an ATH during this week when BTC topped at 70k, reaching $0.209 on Wednesday 31st, before the monthly candle closed, and marking the third consecutive month of gains. As another relevant fact, KAS has come in behind Litecoin in market cap, reaching $4.9 billion.\u2023 Kaspa is investigating the implementation of Smart Contracts through Rollups (RU) to enhance the speed and efficiency of blockchain transactions. This advancement aims to broaden the use cases for its network and boost its adoption.Recent Price MovementsKAS recently reached a new ATH in the $0.209 area on Wednesday 31 July, ending the month more than 8% positive. This shows the current strength of the price, also reflected in the charts as it has not broken the uptrend it has been in since hitting its April low at the lower edge of the reversal zone from the January 2024 low.Should this strong uptrend continue, the probability indicates that it could head towards the $0.215 area, where the 1.27 Fibonacci level from the February high is located.Future PerspectivesGiven that the price of KAS has managed to break the $0.19 area to the upside, should it hold it during the current pullback that it is having the last two days, it could generate a rebound and a bullish pattern that could take it back to the ATH area and even surpass it.In case of rejecting the upside of the $0.19 area, it could make a re-entry at $0.191 looking for the ATH area as a first target, and $0.215 as a 2nd target.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesNear\u2023 NEAR has had a week of sharp falls, accumulating a negative 11% approximately. If it fails to support the $4.55-$4.05 zone, the price could head towards the $3.45-$2.69 zone.Fantom\u2023 FTM has re-tested the $0.4 area and is currently holding. In case it breaks this support, the price could head towards $0.36 - $0.33 - $0.27."}]}

These strategic moves indicate potential market growth and increased adoption of Quant's technology, suggesting a promising trajectory for the network's future.QNT in the key zone: could it form a floor?This week's most important news for the crypto market and its impact on Quant\u2019s price development were as follows:\u2023 After weeks of market weakness, Bitcoin has finally bounced back to 70k following the Bitcoin 2024 conference where Donald Trump made a strong pro-crypto speech. In the same context, QNT seems to have made a floor at the $65 support level, which it is currently respecting but should remain a barrier for the price, otherwise, we could see falls towards $58 - $52 and even $40.\u2023 Additionally, the launch of the Ethereum ETF produced an apparent trap move in the market, given that after its launch on Tuesday, July 23, there was a sharp drop for two consecutive days, a sign of weakness for the queen of cryptocurrencies at least in the short term.\u2023 Turning to macroeconomics, U.S. Federal Reserve bond yields held steady for August, and Jerome Powell's speech was measured, making a future rate cut in September contingent on August inflation data. Interestingly, the market is already discounting a cut but is debating between the 25 and 50-point options.\u2023 Finally, the price of QNT has continued to decline this week (the QNT/USDT pair), but has remained stronger over the past two weeks than its competitors Layers 0 ATOM and DOT, which is also evident in its Bitcoin pairs, with QNT being the strongest in its QNT/BTC pair.Recent Price MovementsQNT has had a week of continued downward movement and is currently on the verge of retesting the $65 level. This zone must be maintained to the upside in order to have a better bullish outlook in the short term.In case it loses this zone, the next levels to visit would be from $58 as marked on the chart with purple labels.The $81-$113 zone is the reversal zone from the ATL, and given that the price has already topped twice at $81, it could be considered as a short-term resistance.Should it manage to hold the zone, ideally $85 should be broken for the probability of a significant bullish bounce to take place.Future PerspectivesShould the price of QNT consistently break down to the $65 level and hold it as resistance, a short trade could be sought with a final target at the ATL, i.e. the $40 area.In case the price manages to bounce off the $65 area or hold it upwards forming a short-term floor, the probability of a bullish bounce towards $97 would at least increase from $85, where the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high is located.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesPolkadot\u2023DOT continues to decline and has broken key supports such as $5.33, which was the lower edge of the reversal zone from its October 2023 low and ATL.

This aligns with its roadmap and is supported by co-founder Charles Hoskinson, who highlights enhancements in scalability and transaction efficiency with the Ouroboros Leios consensus mechanism. Increased whale transactions indicate heightened interest from influential investors, suggesting that there could be a trend reversal in the price which is currently bearish in the short term.Recent developments include the release of Cardano Node 9.1.0, which enhances the network's functionality and scalability and its crucial for the upcoming Chang Hard Fork. Also MinSwap, a decentralised exchange on the Cardano network, presented a new upgrade called Plutus V2, which improves platform efficiency and security. Additionally, zkFold's announcement of a ZK Rollup launch on Cardano is expected to enhance scalability and privacy, making Cardano more attractive for diverse applications.What has happened with ADA this week?\u2023 Despite the positive impact of the first days of Donald Trump's speech at the BItcoin 2024 conference, BTC started its fall from the top of the descending channel it has been describing for the last months, rejecting 70k downwards. ADA in the same way fell respecting the downward trend line that it has also been respecting since it reached the 2024 high in the $0.81 price zone.\u2023 Cardano is preparing for the Chang hard fork, a key step towards decentralised governance. The latest validator node release, Node 9.1.0, was made on July 8th, and is required for this transition which will implement core elements of on-chain governance. As validators rapidly upgrade, the network is moving towards a more decentralised model, involving community voting and governance roles for stake pool operators. This upgrade, part of the Voltaire era, aims to enhance Cardano's governance framework and follows previous improvements from the Vasil and Alonzo hard forks.\u2023 Macroeconomics seems not to have affected ADA, as during Wednesday, July 31, where the news of the Fed's decision to maintain bond rates was announced, but where there was a speech that would open the door to a possible rate cut in September, the price of the token fell more than 3%.What Are the Latest Price Movements?Cardano has continued to respect the downtrend line it has been following since reaching its high of $0.81, using this downtrend line multiple times during the last few days as a resistance for its price.Currently, it is retesting the $0.355 price zone, which if exceeded to the bearish side, could generate the price to head towards $0.28 - $0.23.For the probability of a bullish bounce to increase, ADA should first break the bearish upward trend line, and ideally overcome the $0.525 zone, which is the strongest resistance that the price has in the short term.What Are the Future Perspectives?In case the ADA price manages to bounce upwards towards the upper part of the reversal zone from the October 2023 low, two entries could be considered:\u2023 The first one at $0.463, is riskier and once the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high and the same level from the April 2022 high are surpassed.\u2023 The second one at $0.525 with more confirmation once the last relative highs and the 0.38 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high are overcome.Weekly Evolution of the Other CryptocurrenciesSolana\u2023 SOL has had a strongly negative week, after rejecting the $190 zone downwards since Monday, July 29. Should it continue to decline, it could find itself at $150 - $129.Avalanche\u2023 AVAX remains bearish for the second week in a row, after rejecting the $31 level.

This decline can beattributed to the broader bearish market impacting major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, leading to heightened sell pressureacross the market, including DeFi tokens. Theliquidity and trading volumes on Uniswap were also adversely affected by the market crash, exacerbating the price decline. Investor concerns about the immediate utility and demand for UNI amidst substantial cash reserves, combined with the speculative period leading up to the anticipated launch of Uniswap V4, added to the volatility.Despite recent positive developments, CAKE token has experienced a significant price decreasedue to the broader crypto market crash. Thebearish trend has led to decreased liquidity and trading volumes, exacerbating the decline in DeFi tokens. Investor sentiment remains cautious, overshadowingPancakeSwap's advancements such as the integration with OKX Wallet, the launch of the gamified PancakeSwap Quest platform, and ongoing deflationary measures, including the burning of 8,864,331 CAKE tokens valued at $12 million and a total of 12.9 million CAKE tokens blackholed.Why Has SUSHI Seen the Least Decline?Finally,SUSHI has seen a strong price decreasedue to the broader crypto market crash,despite the launch of the Sushi Route Processor 5 (RP5), an upgrade that enhances liquidity aggregation, integrates new sources like Curve, and supports over 40 liquidity sources across multiple networks. Themarket-wide bearish sentiment has led to reduced liquidity and trading volumes, exacerbating the decline in SUSHI's price.

What Today\u2019s Jobless Claims RevealWhat are the signs?\u2023 The morning of August 8th saw the release of the weekly US jobless claims report, widely expected by all traders given the weakness the stock market has shown after last week's fall and the idea of a \u2018soft landing\u2019 seemed to be decreasing, with predictions of a recession before the end of the year among major banks increasing\u2023 The data favoured the markets as claims were lower than expected (233k actual vs. 241k expected), generating a continuation of the relief bounce in the S&P500.\u2023 It is interesting to note that in a context where the FED is expected to cut interest rates (due to low inflation or fear of a recession affecting labour and consequently the economy), strong labour market data is positive for the markets, unlike last month, where a strong labour market data would have been negative and bearish for the market because it would be assumed that the interest rate cut would take longer to come. This is because now that there are genuine concerns about a recession, bad economic data is no longer being primarily interpreted as a sign the Fed might cut interest rates but instead a sign of a wider economic slowdown, which is bad for stocks and crypto.BTC and the market: On a tightrope or adjusting candles?\u2023 As the jobless claims report on Thursday, August 8 came out stronger than expected, the market took this data as positive and as a sign of relief, bouncing off the $5181 support with strength to the upside.\u2023 It is also important to mention that the price had tested the lower level of the reversal zone from the April low at $5092, which was quickly rejected to the upside.\u2023 A break of the $5310 area would also be beneficial for the price to continue higher, breaking this week's last relative high and forming a higher high.\u2023 Should the market continue higher with this bounce which is so far a relief rally, the key area to monitor would be the reversal zone from the ATH at $5456 - $5558. A downside rejection of this area could trigger a price drop to break the $5092 support seen earlier this week.\u2023 In the case of Bitcoin, the positive news on the unemployment claims brought bullish strength, as it rejected the 57k area on the upside and is currently heading towards 60k.\u2023 Should it break above the $59730 level which is its nearest resistance, it could go to $61820 - $62982 and eventually $65567 which would be the upper margin of the reversal zone from the 70k high reached on Monday, July 29th before the drop to 49k on Monday August 5th.Playing devil's advocateThe S&P500 bounced higher again at $5180 after the positive Unemployment Claims data.Breaking $5310 would be beneficial in the short term.The key area to monitor is $5456 - $5558.Chart analysis suggests high volatility as the current scenario is still uncertain about a rebound to new highs or a continuation of the declines."}]}

Despite these advancements, challenges such as concerns over governance and transparency persist, potentially influencing market sentiment.The restructuring and technological expansions are aimed at enhancing SushiSwap\u2019s multi chain capabilities, and it is worth mentioning that they have also expanded their use to the Base, Arbitrum and Celo networks, which would be an additional source of stable currency inflows and general activity. Even during a period of lower trading volumes, Sushi Swap is still one of the most active projects in terms of development activity, being among the top 3 blockchain projects according to code commits.Key Zone Alert: SUSHI\u2019s Potential Floor Formation?This week's most important news for the crypto market and its impact on Sushi\u2019s price development were as follows:\u2023 After hitting a low of 49k on Monday 5 August, Bitcoin has bounced strongly to the upside to re-enter its bearish channel and has recently reached the 62.7k area, which is located near the centre line of the channel.\u2023 Following this, the Bitcoin price has rejected the 62k area to the downside, but still remains above the key 60k area, which in the short term would be positive for the market and especially for altcoins that are at levels close to their ATL such as SUSHI.\u2023 In addition to this, last week saw a reversal in market sentiment on the \"bad news\" when the latest employment report came out below expectations, which was taken as bad news by the market leading to sharp declines in all assets, including Bitcoin and altcoins. Such a change would now mean that inflation is no longer a problem, that rate cuts are more certain in the short term, and that the future problem to avoid is an economic recession.\u2023 Fortunately, the unemployment claims report came in lower than expected on Thursday the 8th, which produced further relief bounces in all markets, including Bitcoin and altcoins.\u2023 Finally, SUSHI broke below its all-time low on Monday, August 5th, forming a new ATL in the $0.44 area as Bitcoin touched 49k, only to reject that area to the upside. It is currently above the $0.55 support, which should give it more stability in the short term.Recent Price Movements: SUSHI\u2019s StrugglesSUSHi has recently formed a new ATL as mentioned in the $0.44 area, breaking the last historical low at $0.47. While the breakout was not by a large gap and the area was quickly rejected to the upside, it is evidence of the current weakness in the price of SUSHI, which would increase should the $0.55 level be broken to the downside again, as this is the last historical support for the price prior to the ATL.In case the price regained the $0.775 area, the probability of a bullish bounce would increase.Looking Ahead: Price Targets for SUSHIShould SUSHI price regain the $0.775 area, it could gain probability for a bullish bounce and a first entry with a moderate confirmation level as the last relative high would have been breached.If its price breaks above the $0.89 level, it would have breached the 0.23 Fibonacci level from the 2024 high, which would give it a higher confirmation level for a bullish bounce to at least the $1.1 area.kWeekly Update on Other DeFi GiantsPancakeSwap:\u2023 CAKE has recently rejected the $1.29 area to the upside, which is the last support before the ATL at $1.06. Should it bounce above $2.13, it would form a higher high and the probability of a rebound would increase.Uniswap:\u2023 UNI has rejected upwards its historical support at $4.72, quickly recovering the $5.5 level, which in principle would be positive for its short-term development."}]}

It is worth noting that the US government is the largest geopolitical holder of Bitcoin, holding around 203,000 BTC.Can Bitcoin Recover After a Volatile Week of Mixed Signals?\u2023During the most important week of macroeconomic data in the United States, the Core PPI (which indicates the change in prices that producers receive for their goods and services) was released on Tuesday 13, which was positive for the markets in general and also for Bitcoin, which saw an increase of almost 5% during the same Tuesday.\u2023BTC's eye-catching performance started on Wednesday, after the release of perhaps the most important data of all, the CPI, which was also in line with expectations in its monthly version, but was better than expected in the annualised value.\u2023At the time of the release, the price of Bitcoin fell from $61800 to close the day around $58700, down 5%. It was learned that the losses in BTC were mostly composed of outflows from ETFs listed in the US, especially the Grayscale GBTC ETF which was the most affected.\u2023Thursday also saw news that the US government moved 10,000 BTC from its wallets, raising doubts about possible future sales and further deepening the price decline.\u2023This behaviour went against the general trend of the rest of the market and gained further attention on Thursday morning, when retail sales data and the weekly Unemployment Claims report were also released, both of which were positive. Bitcoin started the day on the upside after the good news, almost testing the 60k level, but after midday it rejected the area sharply and started a fall of more than 6% which took it to visit the 56k level. It remains to be seen if during Friday it recovers the 60k zone in line with what the market expected in a context of favourable data.Is Bitcoin Losing Ground?As mentioned above, Bitcoin has behaved atypically in a scenario of positive macroeconomic news that has also turned out to be positive for the rest of the risk asset markets.Most notable this week has been the clear rejection of the 62k level, at least in the short term, which represents the lower margin of the reversal zone from its last high at 70k. It is also worth noting that the positive macroeconomic data only produced gains on Tuesday, as on Wednesday and Thursday both the CPI and the Retail Sales and Unemployment Claims reports generated further declines in the price, causing it to test the 56k level.Should the price break down to the 57k level, we could see the price of BTC move further away from the 60k psychological level.Two Key Scenarios Unfold: Will Bitcoin Bounce or Break?Bitcoin is currently respecting the reversal zone drawn from its last low, located between $5700 and $56300.\u2023 Bullish: that the BTC price bounces upwards respecting that zone, and heading towards the reversal zone from the 70k high, between $62000 and $65500, where it would face its major short-term resistance.\u00a0 A possible entry to take advantage of this scenario could be after breaking the reversal zone from the CPI news high at $60850.\u2023 Bearish: for BTC to break below the 57.7k-56.3k zone, triggering higher selling volumes that could take the price towards $53870 as the first target.Targeting the Next Bitcoin Surge: Optimal Buy Ranges"}]}

Pills are earned through activities like holding Yield Tokens (YT), providing liquidity, or participating in Pendle campaigns such as the USD0++ campaign. The earning rate varies based on user activity, with dynamic multipliers offering higher rewards for long-term or active participants. This new incentive structure goes beyond enhancing yields by promoting long-term loyalty and deeper user involvement.Pills can also be converted into $USUAL tokens, tying into governance and potentially increasing user retention, liquidity. This strategic move is expected to enhance Pendle\u00b4s appeal as a Defi Platform. Moreover, this kind of focus on community-driven initiatives and user rewards aligns with broader trends in decentralized finance, where user engagement is crucial for sustainable growth.PENDLE: Rerouting the Path To Bullish Momentum?Over the past six weeks, PENDLE experienced a sharp decline against BTC, marked by two weeks of drops followed by a brief pause, only to continue falling for three consecutive weeks. This decline amounts to roughly 60% from its recent high, breaking through both the 20-day (red) and 50-day (green) moving averages. Currently, the price is poised at a key level of support, highlighted in green, which is now being tested for the second time\u2014the first retest occurring last March 2024 after the BTC ETF rally. The relative strength index (RSI) is also noteworthy, as it is approaching the middle line, suggesting a gradual buildup in momentum that could lead to a bullish trajectory.Setting Up for a Rebound After a 70% Drop?Against USDT, PENDLE is currently 70% below its recent peak, reflecting the broader market sentiment following the BTC ETF rally earlier this year and the ETH ETF rally in May. Since then, PENDLE has been in a downtrend, forming a series of lower lows and lower highs. However, selling pressure seems to have eased, with prices holding above key moving averages. Supported by the 100-day moving average (moving average in color purple) and a market structure (box highlighted in color green) reacting to previous consolidation, PENDLE could see a short-term bounce. If it avoids forming another lower low, PENDLE may start reversing its trend.If It Bounces Back, What\u2019s Next?\u2023 Short-Term: If PENDLE continues to hold the $1.82 mark, a bounce can occur heading towards $4.62 level.\u2023 Mid-Term: If PENDLE breaks above $4.62, it could challenge breaking the next resistance level pegged at $7.53\u2023 Long-Term: If the $1.82 mark successfully holds over a long period of time, it could challenge the previous all-time high pegged at $7.53 or could even record a new all-time high price (Fibonacci 1.61 extension level pegged at $11.11).The introduction of Pendle's 'Pills' reward system is likely to have a significant impact on the asset's medium to long-term price trajectory. By incentivizing long-term holding and deeper user engagement, 'Pills' could drive an increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) on the platform, thereby boosting Pendle's overall market share in the DeFi space. This fundamental development may enhance investor confidence and attract new participants, potentially providing a strong foundation for a sustained price recovery. As a result, the ongoing downtrend could find a more solid support level, increasing the likelihood of a trend reversal and making PENDLE a more attractive option for long-term investors."}]}

These countries have been exploring alternatives to the US dollar to gain more economic independence and reduce reliance on the dollar, which has long dominated global trade. This shift is driven by geopolitical tensions and the use of the US financial system for sanctions.India and the UAE are leading this change within BRICS. A recent deal where India used local currencies to pay for UAE crude oil, facilitated by the XRP Ledger System, marks a significant step forward. This system bypasses the US dollar and integrates blockchain technology, offering participants cashback in CryptoTradingFund (CTF) tokens. Ripple\u2019s involvement in the region, including its partnership with the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), underscores its strategic push to advance blockchain and digital asset innovation in the UAE.Has XRP Broken Free, or Is the Downtrend Still Lurking?XRP has finally broken out of its midterm downtrend since July 2023 against BTC, surpassing the trendline in May 2024. After 18 weeks of consolidation, it staged a breakout, with the price staying above the 20-day moving average (moving average in red) for seven weeks.The relative strength index, which measures the speed and change of price movement, also climbed above the middle line (RSI50), signalling a potential end to the bearish momentum. Ripple (XRP) may have bottomed out, supported by its historical low from March 2021. However, caution is still advised, as XRP remains near a critical support level and the Bitcoin Dominance continues to slowly move towards 60% rate suggesting Bitcoin\u2019s continued dominance in the market capital. If this immediate support (highlighted in green) fails, XRP could hit another all-time low. In due time, integrating XRP into major international transactions, like the oil deal between India and the UAE, points to a promising future for cryptocurrency. XRP could become a viable alternative to traditional currencies in global trade, especially within the BRICS bloc, which seeks to reduce dependence on the US dollar.Has it turned the corner after its long downtrend?XRP finally broke through its long-term trendline resistance that had held since April 2021. The breakout occurred in July, with XRP gradually moving above all the key moving averages\u2014an important shift, as these indicators often serve as resistance levels. This upward move was also supported by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) rising above the RSI50 mark, hinting at the end of XRP\u2019s bearish momentum. Currently, XRP is in a brief consolidation phase, trading between $0.46 and $0.92. However, despite this breakout, it remains in a bearish trajectory based on the short-term consolidation pattern. Nonetheless, if XRP successfully breaks the $0.92 levels and maintains it over a period of time, it signals a higher-low structure marking it as the first bullish structure coming from a series of lower-highs and lower-lows.Can XRP Hold $0.50 and Surge Toward $1.41?\u2023Short-Term: If XRP holds the psychological value support at $0.50 where all the moving averages are above it supporting the price, XRP could take its immediate resistance pegged at $0.92.\u2023Mid-Term: If XRP successfully breaks above $0.92 given a retest has been done, its next resistance is at the highs of September 2021 pegged at $1.41.\u2023Long-Term: After three years, XRP has broken free from its long-term downtrend.

We can state that the reversal zone (0.61-0.78 Fibonacci levels) from the January low and the lower edge of the bullish channel that the DAX has been describing since September 2022, served as support for the rebound along with the positive macroeconomic data in August.\u2023 In addition, key data for the DAX was released on Tuesday August 20, such as the German PPI which came in aligned with expectations, and the Euro-zone Core CPI, which also came out in line with expectations.DAX 4H Chart\u2023 Currently, the price has rebounded to reach the reversal zone from the ATH between 18,180-18,500 points, an area that if broken to the upside would give a higher probability that the rebound will continue at least to the ATH in the 18,900 point area, and could also extend towards 19,400-20,050, where the 1.27-1.61 Fibonacci levels from the ATH are located, as well as the upper limit of the bullish channel.\u2023 Although today's two macroeconomic data could be considered neutral or even positive for the DAX, during the day the market has been rejecting the upper limit of the above-mentioned reversal zone at 18500 points.DAX\u2019s Bold Move: Will BTC Follow?\u2023 As for Bitcoin, while its correlation with the German DAX has been increasing in recent years (mainly since the COVID-19 crisis), it cannot always be said to be consistent, as this correlation can weaken in periods of specific volatility especially in the crypto market. This correlation can also be influenced by global macroeconomic factors such as monetary policy, inflation and interest rate expectations.\u2023 In an environment where the Fed is expected to cut interest rates, the relationship between DAX and BTC could become more relevant, as if the Fed cuts rates, global equity markets would be more likely to benefit as it would increase risk appetite, also stimulating capital inflows to the crypto market.\u2023 Paradoxically, Bitcoin has not been behaving with the same strength as the stock markets, as its rebound since August 5th has been less pronounced than the DAX and S&P500, taking last week's positive macroeconomic news such as the CPI and Unemployment Claims as bearish.\u2023 The market expects Bitcoin to regain the 62k-65.5k level, and like the S&P500 and DAX to re-enter the reversal zone from the last high of 70k, which would increase the likelihood of a bullish bounce to new highs.BTC 4H Chart\u2023 Another important point is that this week we will have the FED minutes, several macroeconomic data from Europe (as well as today), and we will have the weekly Unemployment Claims and Flash Manufacturing PMI report, as well as the Jackson Hole symposium, where FED Chairman Jerome Powell will speak.DAX\u2019s Next Move: the Trigger for Bitcoin\u2019s Comeback?1.The DAX has again reached its reversal zone between 18,000-18,500.2.Bitcoin will need to break 62k-65.5k to continue its upward rebound.3.In the event of breaking 18,500-18,900, the DAX could have a further upside up to 19,400-20,050.4.The charts suggest high volatility, so special care in leveraged positions is suggested for successful trades."}]}

This upgrade introduced a mechanism where a portion of transaction fees is permanently removed from circulation, or \"burned,\" thereby reducing the total supply of ETH. The burn rate has since become a key metric for understanding Ethereum's deflationary potential. Historically, periods of high network activity, such as during bull markets or the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), have led to increased burn rates. This activity reflected Ethereum's growing utility Recently, the Ethereum network has burned just over 460,000 ETH in 2024. As of August 5, 2024, CoinGecko reports 465,657 ETH have been burned this year. In Q2 2024, only 107,725 ETH were burned, a 67.7% drop from the first quarter's 333,555 ETH. July 2024 saw a record low for the year, with just 17,114 ETH burned\u2014a 35% decrease from June. Ethereum emissions have outpaced burns, with 540,958 ETH added to the network since the start of 2024, leaving a net total of 75,301 ETH added.The recent burn rate highlights a sharp decline in Ethereum's burn rate in 2024, with a significant drop in Q2 compared to Q1 and a monthly low in July. This decline is particularly notable because it represents a reversal of the deflationary trend that had been a key selling point for Ethereum since the introduction of EIP-1559. The shift from deflationary to inflationary conditions suggests that network activity has slowed down considerably, which could be a concern for those who view ETH's deflationary nature as a key component of its value proposition.Is ETH Stuck in a Downtrend or Ready to Break Free?Against BTC, ETH is currently in a downtrend since September 2022 as it failed to maintain the $0.066 level considered as a higher-low structure of the pair. When the price broke down on the said level, it started forming a series of lower highs and lower lows which confirms the structure of a bearish trend. The $0.06 level acts as a strong resistance, where the 100-day moving average and the recent lower-high structure intersect. ETH/BTC is approaching its all-time low. The $0.034 level could serve as a potential bounce point, as it aligns with the bottom support of the channel.While a break above $0.044, based on a 15-minute chart, might indicate a short-term trend shift, it doesn\u2019t ensure a complete reversal of the overall downtrend. ETH needs to stay on top of the $0.0586 level, the lower-high market structure,\u00a0 to confirm a reversal based on the present low pegged at $0.039. By the time ETH/BTC move towards $0.0586, the 100-day moving average (moving average in color purple) also hovers around the said level marking it as another potential resistance. The decline in burn rate led to Ethereum turning inflationary again for the first time since The Merge in September 2022 and is impacting the recent price declining at roughly 25% coming from $0.05 down to $0.04 against BTC.Inflation Pressures and Resistance: Can ETH Break Through?With the network being deflationary for only 7 days in Q2 of 2024, compared to 66 days in Q1, since July, ETH's price has fallen from $3,561 to $2,127, a 40% decline over three weeks. Recently, the price rebounded from its low, supported by the 100-day moving average (moving average in purple) and a key historical level (box highlighted in green). However, with ETH currently in an inflationary phase, it\u2019s struggling to break above the $2,700 mark, where the 50-day moving average acts as immediate resistance.Can ETH Hold and Climb Higher?\u2023 Short-Term: If ETH holds above $2,179, it could bounce to $3,199 where the 20-day moving average is currently hovering around.\u2023 Mid-Term: If ETH breaks above $3,199, it could take over the recent key level resistance pegged at $4,062.\u2023 Long-Term: If the $2,179 continues to hold over time, ETH could break the previous all time high near the $4,628 level."}]}

In addition, the BoJ's rate hike and the end of the Yen carry trade also affected the DXY, which in this case is weakening against the Japanese Yen.\u2023 The combined effect of both news led the index from 104 to break the 103 support, even reaching the 102 zone, but beyond the graphic effect, it is important to mention that this fall put the markets (including crypto and Bitcoin) on alert about a possible entry into recession in the United States, which in a context of high interest rates and expectations of cuts for September would define the effective rate cut to prevent the US labour market from collapsing, which would generate a drop in consumption, in the collection of companies and the State through taxes.DXY 4H Chart\u2023 After the fall to test the 102 area, the DXY started a recovery towards 103, only to reject it to the downside during the week of August 12, where all US macroeconomic data was positive. The expectation of a rate cut in September is also generating a strong rebound in the stock market and a \u2018risk on\u2019 scenario, where investors would allocate funds in risky assets such as equities, exiting safe-haven instruments such as the dollar and even US bonds that would yield lower yields, weakening the overall demand for dollars.\u2023 In case the DXY manages to break below the 101.2 support, it could head towards the 99.8 area, breaking the psychological support at 100, which would show further weakness in the dollar.Is Bitcoin Set to Soar as DXY Crumbles?\u2023 Bitcoin has had a relief bounce since reaching the 49k area on Monday, August 5, at which time the S&P500 also bottomed near 5100 and the DXY reached 102.16.\u2023 After that fall, the relief bounce took BTC to test the 62k level, where the reversal zone from its last high of 70k is located, rejecting it to the downside several times since then.\u2023 Bitcoin's behaviour is notorious in this context where the DXY is falling sharply, as they have historically shown a negative correlation, being that as explained, in a \u201crisk on\u201d scenario, risk assets such as Bitcoin tend to appreciate due to higher demand generated by expectations of higher dividends, and safe haven assets such as the dollar lose demand.BTC 4H Chart\u2023 It remains to be understood how Bitcoin will perform with the DXY testing key supports and with macroeconomic data due out this week such as the FOMC minutes and Unemployment Claims, as well as important macroeconomic data from the Euro Zone, which could push its price towards the reversal zone from 62k, or make it fall back towards the lower edge of the bearish channel it has been describing.The Big Fall of the DXY1.The DXY has been falling sharply from 104 since early August.2.Bitcoin has bounced from 49k to the upside, but without breaking key resistances like the stock market.3.Bitcoin's performance seems to be lagging behind the rest of the risk assets.4.In this context of high volatility, caution is advised when making trades, especially those with leverage."}]}

However, on the day of the unlock, the price dropped by 6.17%. The following day, the downward trend continued, culminating in a total decline of 10.70%.In contrast, the day before the token unlock on 20 August witnessed a 5.09% decline in AVAX's price. Yet, on the day of the event, the price surged by 8.88%. The subsequent days have shown continued growth, with a cumulative increase of 14.47% since the day of the unlock.It's important to note that on the day of the latest unlock in August, the RSI reached 80.83, indicating a clear overbought condition. The RSI remained above 70 multiple times over the past two days, signalling elevated buying pressure. Although it has currently dropped to 67, the market still shows signs of intense buying activity, which could suggest a potential for price correction.Avalanche (AVAX) currently has a TVL of $879.95 million. In May, it experienced a noticeable decline, but it began to recover between June 22nd and July 22nd. However, towards the end of July, the TVL dropped again, continuing until August 4th. Since then, it hasstabilized, holding steady at around $800 million.Post-unlock reactionBefore both unlocks, the price increased, and on the day of the unlock, the upward trend continued in August, whereas May saw a brief decline. While the May unlock led to a price drop in the following days, the August unlock maintained its upward momentum.\u2023Both unlocks are \"cliff unlocks\" designated for Strategic Partners, the Foundation, the Team, and Airdrops.

The collaboration allows users toearn additional Pills through various Pendle products such as Yield Tokens (YT) and Liquidity Provider Tokens (LP), with boosted rewards like daily Pills accrual and multipliers that enhance long-term value.These new incentives have likelydrawn significant user interest, increasing liquidity and engagementwithin the Pendle platform. By offering an attractive mechanism for maximising returns, particularly through Pills rewards and flexible participation across the network and Usual products, the partnership has likely spurred demand for Pendle, contributing to its upward price movement.On the other hand,Aave's substantial price jump, surpassing other protocols, stems from key strategic moves, including the potential onboarding of TBTC and its launch on the ZKsync Era Layer 2 network. Responding to concerns about WBTC custodial changes,the protocol's proposal to integrate TBTC offers users a more decentralized Bitcoin alternative, enhancing its appeal in the DeFi space.

In case of continuing its upward movement, the next level to break would be the $2531 level where the ATH is located, close to the 1.27 Fibonacci level from the last high, and then $2564, where the 1.61 level of the same retracement is located. In case of overcoming these two levels, the next resistances would be at $2600-$2660-$2694.Gold\u2019s on Fire: What\u2019s Driving the Demand?\u2023 Gold's successive strong upward movements have attracted attention, as it is a safe-haven asset that tends to benefit in contexts of falling stock markets and high uncertainty. This behavior can be explained in a context where the dollar and FIAT currencies in general are losing weight as safe haven assets given the inflationary pressures that have been generated since the COVID-19 crisis due to excess monetary issuance.\u2023 In this context, Central banks have accelerated gold purchases, also motivated by geopolitical tensions, inflation fears, and a desire to diversify away from the U.S. dollar. Since 2022, this shift has pushed gold demand to historic levels, supported by key players like China and Russia. Statistically, this buying trend aligns with increased global uncertainty, indicating a strong appetite for safe-haven assets.\u2023 The sustained demand from central banks is also linked to efforts to reduce dependency on the dollar, especially amid growing economic sanctions and multipolar global dynamics. This move bolsters gold's long-term value despite the dominance of the dollar in global trade.Gold 4H ChartIs Bitcoin Following Gold\u2019s Safe Haven Play?\u2023 Regarding Bitcoin's correlation with Gold, both have benefited in terms of positive price action since October 2023. Bitcoin has continuously sought to position itself as a safe haven asset in the last few years, something which Gold has been perceived to be for decades. Bitcoin so far though has proved to be a lot more volatile.\u2023 Likewise, the rise of both assets has occurred for different reasons, Gold on the other hand has seen a rise due to global uncertainty regarding which assets would serve in the future as a safeguard of value, and Bitcoin has seen rises due to the strengthening of the stock market and increased overall liquidity, and could also continue to benefit from this going forward given the rebound that the stock market and global markets are having.Bitcoin Stalls as Gold Soars\u2014What\u2019s Next?BTC 4H Chart\u2023 However, as already explained in other reports, BTC has not been behaving in the same way as Gold and the stock market in the last few days, as it has rejected to the downside the 62k zone, where the reversal zone traced from its last high of 70k begins, underlining the hypothesis of a lower high and of continuing within the descending channel in which it has been since the end of February.\u2023 As long as it fails to recover 62k and break the 65.5k level to the upside, the descending channel formation would gain strength and could generate deeper corrections in Bitcoin.Gold keeps rising!1.Gold has continued its bullish run by breaking its previous ATH again.2.Bitcoin has rallied from 49k but has not yet managed to break the 62k-65.5 zone to the upside.3.It is noticeable how the correlation that both assets have been carrying since October 2023 is not currently being fulfilled.4.In this context of high volatility, caution is advised when making trades, especially those with leverage."}]}

In the current context, the rate cut would be perceived as monetary easing, which may have mixed effects on the markets.\u2023 In the case of Bitcoin, a rate cut generally weakens the dollar and drives a \u201cRisk on\u201d scenario, which benefits risk assets such as equities and cryptocurrencies. If the minutes confirm a more flexible or \u201cDovish\u201d stance, it could push Bitcoin higher, attracting investors who see in this asset a greater likelihood of profitability in the short and medium term.Should the minutes show doubts or divisions within the Fed over rate cuts, the uncertainty could cause volatility in both the crypto and equity markets.What\u2019s the Real Deal?\u2023 According to according to theCME FedWatchTool, the probability of a 25 bps cut is currently predominant, so a \u201crisk on\u201d scenario would be expected so far, where monetary policy starts to become looser, thus favoring a stock market rebound and a possible \u201csoft landing\u201d. Inflation trends show progress towards the 2% target, with easing price pressures and moderated labor market conditions reinforcing this stance. However, some concerns remain about the broader economic outlook, particularly regarding labor dynamics.\u2023 The market is largely pricing in a September cut, driven by improving inflation metrics and cautious employment growth. While initial uncertainty triggered volatility, subsequent data eased fears of a downturn, increasing confidence in a gradual policy shift. Statistically, if economic data continues trending positively, the Fed is likely to begin easing next month, which could stabilize both traditional and crypto markets in the near termFuel for the S&P500 Rally?\u2023 In the case of the S&P500, given that the FOMC Meeting minutes made it clear that most of the members would agree on interest rate cuts, the index continued to show a slight upward movement, which corresponds with the strong rebound movement it has had since Monday, August 5, when it touched the $5100 level and then rejected that zone to the upside.S&P500 4H Chart\u2023 Currently, the S&P500 is testing the last resistance at $5640 before its ATH, located at $5680, which if surpassed, would take the price of the index towards the $5840 area as the most immediate target.Bitcoin\u2019s Next Move: Boosted by Rate Cut Hopes?\u2023 Bitcoin has continued its sideways market and at times showing weakness since the bounce towards 62k was rejected to the downside. After that, its price even tested the lower edge of the reversal zone drawn from its last low at the $56350 price zone, and then rejected it sharply to the upside.\u2023 During the beginning of the day on Wednesday 21 showed uncertainty and high volatility, to begin to show a bullish behavior from noon and prior to the release of the minutes of the FOMC Meeting, after which it has broken up the reversal zone from its last high that had been reached after the positive news of the CPI on Wednesday 14, i.e. exceeded $ 60850.In the event that this level is sustained upwards, the probability of a rebound towards 62k would increase, but in this zone it would again find a strong resistance since here begins the reversal zone from the 70k high. In case of breaking this zone, it could go as a second target towards 65.5k.\u2023 The remaining unknown, besides the rest of the month's macroeconomic data such as Unemployment Claims and August CPI as the main metrics, is whether the FED will end up cutting rates by 25 or 50 bps. The case of a 25 bps cut would show that the FED is confident in its long term plan and that the fear of a recession is low, which in theory would drive the markets higher. On the other hand, a 50 bps cut, while positive in terms of liquidity available for investment, could also negatively affect markets, including Bitcoin, as it could be taken as the Fed's underlying fear of a possible recession and difficulty in achieving a soft landing.BTC 4H ChartMarkets after FOMC Meeting Minutes1.The S&P500 is bouncing after the FOMC Meeting minutes that would make a September rate cut more likely.2.Bitcoin has broken $60850, has a higher probability of heading towards 62k.3.Overall market would be bullish, favoring the \u201crisk on\u201d scenario.4.In this context of high volatility, caution is advised when making trades, especially those with leverage."}]}

In a scenario where interest rates are expected to be cut, weak home sales could signal economic stress, encouraging more aggressive monetary easing. This environment might boost Bitcoin, as lower rates typically enhance liquidity and risk appetite. Ultimately, Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with this report depends on whether the data aligns with broader expectations for economic relief and liquidity support.S&P500 4H ChartBTC the Tightrope Walker: Can It Stay Balanced?BTC 4H Chart\u2023 Bitcoin has had a bearish day after all the data that has been recorded during Thursday 22nd, currently using as support the $60200 level, where the reversal zone ends from its last high, and that could act as support to head at least towards the $61350 level where the end of the reversal zone is located, and even the 62k level, where the 0.61 Fibonacci level from the 70k high is located and that has already been resistance preventing the continuation of the bullish rebound of the last 2 weeks.\u2023 Should it finally break the 62k level to the upside, it could head towards 65.5k, where the 0.78 Fibonacci level from the 70k high is located and the upper edge of the bearish channel it has been describing since February.For the bearish case, if the 60.2k level is breached, then price could see levels like 57.7k and 56.3k in the short term.Bitcoin in the Spotlight1.The S&P500 has recently rejected the $5640 area to the downside.2.Bitcoin rejecting key resistances that would prevent a near-term bullish bounce continuation.3.Markets have taken the mixed macroeconomic data as negative, and could see a clearer direction after Powell's Jackson Hole speech on Friday.4.In this context of high volatility, caution is advised when making trades, especially those with leverage."}]}

Currently it has made a higher low in the area of 14.5, so this index should be monitored and if it returns to the 21 area, it could generate new lows in the markets.VIX 1D ChartBTC vs VIX: Can't they be avoided?\u2023 Historically, the VIX (Volatility Index) and Bitcoin have shown an inverse, though not perfectly correlated, relationship. When the VIX rises, indicating increased fear in traditional markets, investors tend to dump riskier assets, such as Bitcoin, which tends to lower its price.\u2023 In a context of interest rate cuts, as expected from next month, the impact on this relationship could be complex. A rate cut generally reduces volatility in traditional markets, which could lead to a decline in the VIX. This, in turn, could result in Bitcoin receiving less selling pressure from frightened investors, possibly supporting a rise in its price if risk appetite increases.One's misfortunes could be another's gains?BTC 4H Chart\u2023 Bitcoin has had an initial drop after testing the key 70k area in late July to 65.5k, where after receiving lower than expected employment data and the BoJ rate hike, it fell to the 49k level. From here it has rebounded strongly to test the 62.7k level, where the reversal zone from the 70k high begins.\u2023 If it manages to break the 62k level again and the VIX heads back down and breaks the last low of 14.5, Bitcoin could continue in the short term its recovery towards the upper margin of the reversal zone at 65.5k.Falls and Cautions1.The VIX has had a run to 65 during the S&P500 decline.2.Bitcoin in turn has fallen over 25% in the same period.3.Should the VIX continue to fall, Bitcoin could start to gain strength.4.In this context of high volatility, caution is advised when making trades, especially those with leverage."}]}

Recently and with the fall of the S&P500 at the beginning of August, its price fell to the $71 area, before bouncing back to $80, an area which it also failed to break to the upside. After this and showing a strong weakness, its price fell again to test the $72 level, where the lower margin of the mentioned triangle is located.\u2023 In case it manages to break this support downwards, its price could drop towards the $69.5, $68 and even $64 supports in the short term. In the event of a bullish bounce that generates a break of the $80 resistance, the upper margin of the aforementioned triangle would be broken to the upside, so we could see the $81.5-$84.25 levels more likely in the short term.\u2023 In any case, the triangle that is forming the Oil price action is reaching a key moment where a new context could be defined for this asset that has strong implications for the world economy.USOIL 1D ChartOil and Bitcoin: A Tangled Relationship?\u2023 Historically, oil and Bitcoin have shown limited direct correlation, as they are influenced by different factors. Oil is primarily driven by supply-demand dynamics, geopolitical events, and global economic conditions, while Bitcoin is influenced by adoption, regulation, and macroeconomic factors like liquidity and investor sentiment. However, they both respond to broader macroeconomic shifts, particularly those involving interest rates and inflation expectations.\u2023 In a scenario where interest rates are expected to be cut next month, the outlook for both assets could shift. Lower rates typically weaken the dollar and make traditional assets like bonds less attractive, potentially driving capital toward alternative assets like Bitcoin. On the other hand, lower rates could stimulate economic activity, increasing demand for oil. If liquidity increases, both Bitcoin and oil could see upward pressure, though Bitcoin\u2019s behavior may also depend on risk sentiment and other financial conditions.\u2023 It is important to note that oil prices have a strong impact on inflation, so in the event that oil bounces upwards, inflation could also bounce back or simply decline at a slower pace, making it harder to cut rates and put the price of oil at a higher level.Can Bitcoin Break 62k with Oil Holding Steady?BTC 4H Chart\u2023 As mentioned in the previous analyses, BTC experienced an initial decline after testing the critical 70k level in late July, dropping to 65.5k. Following weaker-than-expected employment figures and a rate hike from the Bank of Japan, it further plunged to 49k. However, from this point, it staged a strong recovery, reaching up to the 62.7k mark, which aligns with the reversal zone stemming from the 70k peak.\u2023 In case it manages to break above 62k and oil stays within the limits provided by the upper margin of the aforementioned triangle, or below $80, it would be easier for the US annual CPI data to stay below 3%, which would improve the odds of a rate cut by the FED, pushing Bitcoin more easily towards 65.5k and higher targets.Turning Points in Play1.Oil is in a long-term triangle formation and approaching a turning point.2.Bitcoin retesting the reversal zone from the 70k high.3.If oil stays below $80, there is a greater chance of a bullish bounce in Bitcoin.4.In this context of high volatility, caution is advised when making trades, especially those with leverage."}]}

This shift sparked a sharp rally in stocks and BTC while driving the DXY lower, as investors brace for capital to flow out of the dollar, weakening it against global currencies.\u2023 A fall in the DXY could generate strong rallies for risk asset markets, as could the S&P500, which during Friday's session rallied back towards the $5650 area. The message is clear: a rate cut could fuel the stock market's upward momentum in the near term.DXY 4H Chart\u2023 It is also noteworthy that the historical negative correlation between the DXY and Bitcoin remained in line on Friday, as while Bitcoin was a bit behind in its price climb at the time of the drop, it did not take long to break through resistance at 60-62k to go for a range between 63.5k-65k which it held over the weekend.Could Bitcoin explode if DXY continues to fall?\u2023 Bitcoin could be poised for a short-term surge, driven by its correlation with a weakening DXY.

While this suggests a degree of resilience within the US labor market, the slight deviation from forecasts has stirred uncertainty. Investors are on edge, weighing the prospects of a potential recession and the much-feared 'hard landing.' Could this subtle shift in unemployment data be the tipping point that either calms or inflames the market's current volatility?Unemployment Claims and Market SentimentWith the S&P500 navigating turbulent waters, Thursday's Unemployment Claims report adds a new layer of complexity. The market's relatively stable reaction indicates a tentative trust in the labor market's strength, yet the thin line between actual and forecasted figures keeps traders on high alert. The possibility of a recession looms large, and the slight miss in expectations may either reinforce or diminish fears of a 'hard landing.'If upcoming unemployment data continues to outperform expectations, the probability of a rate cut in September may diminish further. However, the marginally lower-than-expected figures could still bolster stock market sentiment in the near term, potentially setting the stage for cautious optimism.S&P500 4H Chart: A Pivot Point?The S&P500's response to the latest employment data could be a bellwether for broader market trends. With volatility at its peak, any shift in unemployment figures might catalyze significant moves, particularly in risk-sensitive assets. As the labor market data trickles in, it will be crucial to monitor whether the S&P500 can maintain its current levels or if it will falter under renewed recessionary fears.Bitcoin's Dance with Economic TrendsBitcoin's recent surge past the $60k mark underscores the cryptocurrency's sensitivity to macroeconomic indicators. The strong showing in Unemployment Claims, alongside robust GDP data and NVidia's impressive earnings, has provided a potent mix of optimism for BTC. A successful reclaim of the $62k level could serve as a clear signal of growing investor confidence in the digital asset space.The tech sector's buoyancy, driven by Nvidia's stellar performance, further amplifies Bitcoin's appeal. As tech investment gains momentum, the potential for a rate cut becomes increasingly tangible, painting a bullish picture for Bitcoin and other risk assets in the short term.Navigating a Volatile LandscapeThe intersection of new employment data and Bitcoin's trajectory offers a telling glimpse into the market's current psyche. While the lower-than-expected Unemployment Claims report has injected some optimism into the market, the underlying volatility calls for caution. In this environment, traders should remain vigilant, especially when engaging in leveraged positions. As the market continues to digest these mixed signals, the coming days will likely reveal whether the recent employment figures are a harbinger of stability or a precursor to further turmoil."}]}

Operating on BandChain, a blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK, Band Protocol is compatible with major blockchains like Ethereum, Polkadot, and Solana. It supports multiple data retrieval methods and enables developers to create custom oracles using WebAssembly. The platform\u2019s native token, BAND, is used for staking, governance, and payment for data services, incentivizing participation and securing the network. Band Protocol's strengths lie in its cross-chain compatibility, efficient data aggregation, and decentralized oracle network, making it a crucial asset for DeFi protocols and other applications requiring accurate data.BAND on the Move: Latest UpdatesThe upcoming Band Protocol V3 update is poised to bring substantial enhancements to the platform, focusing on scalability, efficiency, and interoperability. This upgrade aims to boost the performance of Band Protocol's oracle services by increasing throughput and reducing latency, allowing for faster and more efficient data processing. Additionally, the update is expected to lower base fees, making the platform more cost-effective and attractive to new projects. V3 will also simplify the deployment of Oracle scripts, reducing the need for specialized knowledge and promoting broader adoption among developers. These improvements are likely to enhance Band Protocol's market presence and could positively influence the price of the BAND token as the platform appeals to a wider range of users and projects. However, the exact timing of the V3 launch remains undisclosed.A notable feature of the BAND V3 update is the introduction of stBAND, developed in collaboration with STRIDE, a liquid staking platform within the Cosmos ecosystem. This feature is designed to enhance the liquidity of staked tokens by allowing them to be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities while still earning staking rewards. Within Band Protocol, BAND tokens are staked in its decentralized oracle network, where validators use them to process data requests and secure the network.BAND\u2019s Price Future: What\u2019s on the Horizon?When tokens are staked, they are effectively removed from the circulating supply, locking them up for a period of time. This reduction in available supply can exert upward pressure on the token's price, assuming demand remains steady or increases.BAND: Ready to Break Free from the Downtrend?Despite breaking above its long-term trendline resistance, BAND/BTC remains locked in a downtrend, continuously hitting new all-time lows. For the trend to reverse, the price must reclaim the $0.000020 - $0.000032 range (box highlighted in grey). Entering this zone would signal the end of the downtrend and the beginning of an accumulation phase. A critical level to monitor is the 100-day moving average (in blue) near $0.00005886, where the lower-high structure currently resides (marked by the red horizontal line). A decisive break above this point could mark a significant trend reversal, with the formation of a higher-low structure indicating a potential shift in momentum.The recent launch of BAND's liquidity staking adds another layer of utility to the token, enabling its use for governance while earning rewards. This could enhance community engagement and drive greater adoption of the protocol. Although the price impact may not be immediate, the reduction of tokens from the circulating supply due to staking could gain traction over time, contributing to future price support.Reversal or Breakdown? What\u2019s Next for BAND?BAND/USDT remains in a prolonged consolidation phase between $1.22 and $2.81, currently hovering near critical support at $0.8888 (horizontal line in green). This level is crucial; a breakdown could push BAND to revisit its all-time lows. The relative strength index (RSI) is also struggling to move above the RSI50 (May and July), indicating that the momentum is currently neutral but leaning bearish. The 100-day moving average (in blue) is also acting as resistance, with the price unable to sustain levels above it. If BAND manages to hold above $2.84, it could mark the start of a trend reversal, with a higher-low structure emerging on the chart.Is BAND Heading for New Lows?\u2023 Short-Term: If BAND maintains support above $0.89, it could swing to $2.84, where a break of market structure would occur, marking the current lower-high level of the trend.\u2023 Mid-Term: A successful break and hold above $2.84 could see BAND challenge the next resistance at $5.42.\u2023 Long-Term: Sustained support at $0.89 could potentially lead to a rally toward $10.59."}]}

Unlike prior upgrades that delivered incremental tweaks, Pectra brings a suite of substantial advancements poised to redefine how Ethereum operates and is perceived by its community.What Pectra\u2019s Upgrade Means for Ethereum?\u2023 Gas Efficiency: Expect lower transaction costs and increased network throughput\u2014an essential boost as Ethereum continues to scale.\u2023 Smart Contract Flexibility: For the first time, developers will be able to update contracts post-deployment, ushering in a new era of adaptability.\u2023 Enhanced Security: With stronger defences against exploits, user assets will benefit from heightened protection, reinforcing trust in the network.\u2023 The Developer Advantage: Lower Costs, Greater Possibilities Pectra is a boon for developers, significantly reducing deployment costs and simplifying smart contract management. This upgrade unlocks new possibilities across DeFi and other sectors, making Ethereum more attractive for innovation.A Fusion of Upgrades\u2014Prague and Electra Combine in Pectra Set to roll out in Q1 2025, the Pectra upgrade aims to make Ethereum faster, cheaper, and more secure. While protocol upgrades like this can influence Ethereum's price, it's crucial to consider the broader market landscape, including regulatory developments and macroeconomic trends. The true impact on Ethereum\u2019s valuation will only be evident after Pectra\u2019s implementation and the market\u2019s reaction.Will Pectra Ignite an ETH/BTC Breakout?As ETH/BTC remains confined within its descending channel, the chart suggests that a reaction could be imminent when the price approaches the support line. Once the Pectra upgrade is fully implemented and the market has had time to digest its implications, ETH/BTC could potentially break above the channel line, signalling the formation of a new market structure with a higher high. This would not only mark the end of ETH/BTC\u2019s current downtrend but also provide an early indication of a trend reversal. A key level to watch for this reversal is a successful break above $0.0586.As ETH/BTC approaches the lower channel line, the 100-day moving average (noted in purple) is likely to move lower, converging near the $0.0586 level. A break above this threshold would represent multiple bullish signals: a break of the current market structure, with the establishment of a higher high, and a break above the 100-day moving average, confirming a shift to a trend-following setup. While ETH/BTC remains within the channel, the long-term impact of the Pectra upgrade is expected to be favourable.ETH Bounces Back: Will $2,800 Break the Resistance?ETH/USDT has rebounded from its recent low, finding support at the 100-day moving average (highlighted in purple) and a key historical level (box highlighted in green). However, ETH has encountered resistance at the 50-day moving average (in green), which it has struggled to surpass for the past four weeks. While the price hovers near this moving average, the $2,800 level is critical to watch. This level, once a support zone before its breakdown, now serves as immediate resistance. A successful reclaim of $2,800 would allow ETH to re-enter its previous consolidation range (depicted as a Darvas box on the chart), signalling the end of the short-term downtrend.\ufeffCan ETH Hold and Climb Higher?\u2023 Short-Term: If ETH maintains support above $2,193, it could rally towards $3,173, where the 20-day moving average currently hovers.\u2023 Mid-Term: A break above $3,173 could position ETH to challenge the next key resistance level at $3,886.\u2023 Long-Term: Sustained support at $2,193 could eventually lead ETH to surpass its previous all-time high near $4,628."}]}

But before we get there, the upcoming manufacturing data is going to play a big role in determining which way the market winds will blow. The ISM Manufacturing PMI and the S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI are set to give us the lowdown on how things are chugging along in the manufacturing sector, which, spoiler alert, could have a lot to say about U.S. employment.

And with BlackRock expanding its influence, it\u2019s clear that the traditional finance world is getting increasingly comfortable with crypto.Will BlackRock\u2019s Brazil ETF Redirect Ethereum\u2019s Capital Flows?So, what does this mean for Ethereum? On the one hand, the listing of BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF on Brazil\u2019s B3 exchange could be a game-changer. Institutional investors who\u2019ve been on the fence about diving into crypto might find the regulated structure of an ETF appealing. This could lead to new capital flowing into Ethereum, potentially stabilizing its market position and even reducing some of that pesky short-term price volatility.But there\u2019s another side to consider. The simplicity and security of ETFs might tempt some investors to reduce their direct ETH holdings, preferring the more traditional route over the complexities of managing ETH on-chain. If this shift gains momentum, we could see outflows from decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems as investors move toward ETFs and other more conventional financial vehicles.Can Dencun Fix Ethereum's Growing Pains?Ethereum\u2019s been on a bit of a rollercoaster when it comes to upgrades. We\u2019ve seen the London Hard Fork and The Merge, both of which aimed to tackle Ethereum\u2019s well-known issues with scalability and high transaction costs. Now, we\u2019ve got the Dencun upgrade, which is supposed to make things better by cutting transaction costs and boosting efficiency on Layer 2 (L2) solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. These L2s have been doing a lot of the heavy lifting, taking on much of the transaction volume and easing congestion on Ethereum\u2019s main blockchain.But here\u2019s the kicker: Dencun hasn\u2019t exactly lived up to the hype. Instead of smoothing things out, we\u2019re seeing a rise in transaction failures, with failure rates hitting up to 21% on Base and significant impacts on Arbitrum and OP Mainnet. It\u2019s another reminder that, for all the planning and tech wizardry, Ethereum\u2019s journey to scalability is far from straightforward. This situation reflects a broader historical trend where each Ethereum upgrade, despite careful planning, introduces new challenges, casting doubt on the network's reliability.Will PECTRA Break Ethereum's Downtrend?Now, let\u2019s talk charts. ETH/BTC is still stuck in a descending channel, but there\u2019s a glimmer of hope as the price nears the support line. Despite the Dencun hiccups and the potential downside of ETF availability on Brazil\u2019s B3 exchange, Ethereum remains a heavyweight in the crypto world, boasting one of the largest market caps. This suggests it\u2019s less volatile compared to other cryptocurrencies, which might work in its favour.The upcoming PECTRA Upgrade is the next big thing on the horizon, aiming to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability, security, and user experience. If ETH/BTC can break above the channel line, we could see a new market structure with a higher high, signalling the end of the current downtrend and possibly the start of a trend reversal. The key level to watch here is $0.0586\u2014if Ethereum can push through that, it could be off to the races.Can Ethereum Reclaim $2,800?ETH/USDT has been trying to stage a comeback, finding support at the 100-day moving average (highlighted in purple) and a key historical level (boxed in green). But it\u2019s not out of the woods yet. The 50-day moving average (in green) has been acting like a brick wall for the past four weeks, keeping Ethereum from breaking above the $2,800 level. Last week\u2019s close saw ETH slip below $2,500, a move that puts it at risk of further declines. If Ethereum can reclaim $2,800, it will re-enter its previous consolidation range (shown as a Darvas box on the chart), signalling an end to the short-term downtrend.Can ETH Hold and Climb Higher?\u2023 Short-Term: If ETH can hold support above $2,204, it might just have the juice to rally toward $3,135, where the 20-day moving average currently hovers.\u2023 Mid-Term: A break above $3,135 could set ETH up to challenge the next big resistance at $3,886.\u2023 Long-Term: If Ethereum can keep its footing at $2,204, it might eventually surpass its previous all-time high near $4,628.outlo\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

If BTC can get its act together and break $60k with some momentum, the next big hurdle is between $61,000 and $62,000. And if it clears that? We\u2019re talking about a run-up to the $63,850 - $65,300 range.Selling Wall\u2023 Immediate Bearish Zone:Between $58,300 - $57,900.\u2023 Insights:On the flip side, there\u2019s a decent support level around $58,300 to $57,700, but if Bitcoin starts slipping, it could be drawn toward a much stronger order block between $57,100 and $56,800. This area could act like a trampoline, pushing the price back up\u2014but if it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019re looking at a possible drop to the next support zone between $54,000 and $52,300.Liquidity Secrets UnveiledBullish Side:The key resistance for Bitcoin is lurking between $60k and $62k, and if the stars align\u2014meaning the S&P 500 hits new highs and the macroeconomic data that\u2019s due out on Tuesday morning looks good\u2014we could see Bitcoin riding that wave of positive news all the way to the $63,850 to $65,300 range. It\u2019s like Bitcoin\u2019s waiting for the green light, and if it gets it, we might just be in for a nice little rally.Bearish Side:But let\u2019s not get too carried away. If the stock market decides to take a breather from its all-time highs or the economic data doesn\u2019t live up to expectations, Bitcoin could find itself struggling to hold the $58,000 level. With minimal support below that, it could quickly slide down to $57,000, and maybe even $56,000, where the strongest order blocks are hanging out.Trading Tactics\u2023 Long Position:Consider entering at $59,600 with a target range of $61,000 to $62,000. If Bitcoin breaks above $60k, you\u2019ll want to be along for the ride.\u2023 Short Position:If you\u2019re feeling bearish, entering at $58,600 with a target range of $57,000 to $56,000 could pay off. Just keep an eye on those order blocks\u2014if they start giving way, it could be a slippery slope."}]}

Despite the ongoing parade of positive macroeconomic news and the looming prospect of a Fed rate cut in September, Gold just retested its all-time high but decided to take a breather. It\u2019s like Gold is catching its breath before deciding its next move.Since October 2023, Gold has been rallying alongside the stock market, which tells us something interesting: there\u2019s a positive correlation brewing between Gold, equities, and yes, even Bitcoin. But here\u2019s the twist\u2014while Gold has been riding high, it\u2019s also been dealing with some headwinds in the form of stock market volatility and those ever-present global economic and political uncertainties. These factors have been the fuel behind Gold\u2019s ascent to new heights.Gold 4H ChartNow, if Gold starts to deflate or just chill out between $2,300 and $2,500, that might be a sign that market volatility is on the decline, and the appetite for safe-haven assets is waning.

But all is not lost.BTC 4H ChartIf Bitcoin can manage to break back above the $59.5k area, we could see a bullish move towards the $62k-$65.5k range. On the flip side, if it breaks below the $57k zone, it would signal continued weakness, potentially dragging Bitcoin down to the $54k level.Will Bitcoin Keep Lagging?Gold continues to reject the $2525 level downwards, which could signal the formation of a short-term top.Bitcoin showing weakness below 60k.Positive macroeconomic news could generate a \u2018risk on\u2019 scenario, cooling Gold prices and benefiting risk assets such as Bitcoin.But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves\u2014this is a volatile market, and caution is the name of the game, especially if you\u2019re trading with leverage\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

After that, the price action went into a bit of a holding pattern\u2014moving sideways with a slight upward tilt. Fast forward to the 1st September token unlock, and things played out a bit differently. The day before saw a mild dip of 6.10%, followed by a small bump of 4.31%.

Not exactly the news anyone was hoping for after Labor Day. The S&P 500 took one look at the numbers and promptly decided to hit the brakes, sharply rejecting the $5,640 level. That\u2019s a key zone the index needs to clear if it wants to take another shot at those all-time highs. But for now? It\u2019s looking like the market\u2019s going to have to play the waiting game a little longer.S&P500 1H ChartThe S&P 500 is hanging on to $5,556 \u2014that\u2019s the short-term support level it needs to stay above if it wants to keep this upward momentum going. But if it slips below that, we could be looking at a slide to $5,460, and then things get really interesting. The $5,400 level is the make-or-break zone for a bullish continuation, and if it doesn\u2019t hold, we might see a deeper correction that sends capital fleeing from risk assets like Bitcoin and into the comforting arms of safe havens like Gold and long-term Treasury bonds. With TLT back on the radar, investors could start eyeing it as a solid defensive play if the S&P can\u2019t hold the line.Weak Manufacturing Data: Bitcoin\u2019s Next Move?Slightly weaker-than-expected Manufacturing PMI data has rippled through markets, with Bitcoin sliding and rejecting the 59.5k level, underscoring its current positive correlation not just with the stock market but also with broader U.S. macroeconomic trends.This shift points to a scenario where \"good macroeconomic news is good news for the market,\" highlighting that any disappointing data amplifies fears of economic weakness. As hopes for a \"soft landing\" diminish, concerns grow over potential impacts on employment and consumption, fueling a vicious cycle that could further strain the economy.BTC 1H ChartIf Bitcoin can claw its way back above $58k and then break through $59.5k, it\u2019ll basically plant its flag in the $57k-$58k zone as solid support. From there, we could be looking at a nice run back to the $62k-$65.5k range, which would have the bulls feeling pretty good. But if Bitcoin can\u2019t hold $57k, things could get dicey fast. We\u2019re talking about immediate downside targets of $56,350 and $55,400, with a potential plunge to $54k if those levels don\u2019t hold up.The next moves will be critical\u2014either Bitcoin rallies and shows some strength, or we\u2019re in for a deeper dive in the near future.Is Bitcoin Losing Steam While Stocks Stumble?The S&P 500 finally gave up on the $5,640 level, taking a hit after some less-than-stellar Manufacturing data.Bitcoin followed suit, rejecting the $59.5k level, and moving in sync with the stock market.Now, the focus shifts to Thursday, when Jobless Claims and Non-farm Employment data drop. These numbers will be crucial in determining whether the markets can muster a bullish comeback in early September.But hey, don\u2019t get too excited just yet\u2014this is a volatile market, and if you\u2019re playing with leverage, a bit of caution could save you from a world of pain.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

And just when you thought things couldn\u2019t get gloomier, the Eurozone decided to join the party with its own set of disappointing numbers. The HCOB Eurozone Composite PMI came in at 51.0 (vs. 51.2 expected), and the Services PMI clocked in at 52.9 (vs. 53.3 expected).These figures amplify fears of an economic slowdown in the Eurozone, echoing the deceleration seen in the U.S. Both regions now face increasing pressure, highlighting a broader trend of global economic weakness that could weigh heavily on market sentiment.The Euro Index (EXY) continues to slide, rejecting the 112 zones and now falling below the 110 mark. This move aligns with a broader downside rejection from the January 2021 high and the upper boundary of its long-term descending channel. Negative macroeconomic data in the Eurozone could further pressure the EXY, potentially pushing it below 106, with downside targets around 102 if these trends persist through the final months of 2024.EXY 4H ChartBoth the S&P 500 and Bitcoin got caught in the downdraft on Tuesday, with markets reacting sharply to even mildly disappointing data. The reaction shows how fragile investor sentiment is right now, as fears of a recession continue to bubble up.Bitcoin Drops as Eurozone Economy Loses SteamBitcoin wasn\u2019t immune to all this doom and gloom either. After Tuesday\u2019s lacklustre U.S. manufacturing data, Bitcoin took a nosedive, dropping from $59.5k to $55.5k by late evening. Then, when the Eurozone\u2019s macro data hit, Bitcoin didn\u2019t bounce\u2014it\u2019s now hanging around $56.3k, and looking a little worse for wear.BTC 4H ChartIf we get more bad data out of Europe, Bitcoin could be eyeing further drops to $55.4k, maybe even $54k in the short term. For any hope of recovery, Bitcoin needs to reclaim the $59.5k level with a strong daily close. Otherwise, it\u2019s just more downside risk.Is Bitcoin Stuck in the Mud While the Eurozone Slows Down?Both the Composite PMI and Services PMI out of the Eurozone missed expectations, painting a not-so-rosy picture of economic slowdown.Bitcoin, not one to miss the mood, dropped down to test $55.5k and is now hanging around $56.5k, looking a bit shaky.The rest of the week\u2019s macro data will be the real decider\u2014was Tuesday\u2019s drop just a blip, or are we looking at the start of a bigger correction?But hey, don\u2019t get ahead of yourself.

How? By using \"optimistic rollups,\" which is just a fancy way of saying it processes transactions off-chain, bundles them up, and sends them back to Ethereum for validation, kind of like cleaning up after a party.But the real star of the show is Optimism\u2019s latest upgrade\u2014theSuperchain update. It introduces a network of Layer 2 (L2) chains called OP Chains, all sharing the same infrastructure thanks to theOP Stack(more on that in a minute). The idea is to get away from the whole \"multi-chain\" thing where assets and users get split up. Instead, these chains will be standardized and interchangeable, which means developers can build cross-chain apps that feel like they\u2019re on a single network. No more clunky bridges or external systems. Just smooth, seamless blockchain magic.The Superchain is set to launch next year, but here\u2019s the catch:OP\u2019s price might stay stuck in the mudwhile Bitcoin continues to dominate the market. However, once Bitcoin\u2019s party winds down, OP could be one of the top tokens to watch.What is OP Stack?The OP Stack is a standardized, open-source framework powering Optimism, a leading Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. Developed by the Optimism Collective, it forms the base for scalable and interoperable blockchains in the Ethereum ecosystem.What are the Key Features of the OP Stack:\u2023Modular Design:The OP Stack is made of different software components, which means developers can tweak things as needed to build their own Layer 2 solutions.\u2023Scalability and Interoperability:It\u2019s all about making Ethereum less congested and cheaper to use. It also fosters interoperability with a shared message-passing format, enabling seamless communication between different chains.\u2023Open-Source and Community-Driven:As an open-source project, the OP Stack invites global developer contributions, promoting collaboration to build and improve the Ethereum ecosystem. This ensures it remains a public good, accessible to all.\u2023Support for the Superchain Concept:The OP Stack is key to developing the Optimism Superchain, a network of interconnected L2s sharing security and communication layers. This aims to create a unified chain network, boosting efficiency and user experience in Ethereum.\u2023Alignment with Ethereum:The OP Stack is compatible with Ethereum\u2019s architecture, using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its consensus mechanisms. So developers can keep building without needing to learn a new system.In short, the OP Stack is laying the foundation for Ethereum\u2019s next big leap in scalability, with a lot of flexibility for building the next generation of blockchain solutions.Is OP Vulnerable Despite the Superchain Hype?Although Optimism (OP) has recently broken out of its short-term downtrend against Bitcoin (BTC), it remains in a precarious position. The Superchain update, slated for early next year, hasn't been enough to lift OP out of its danger zone. With Bitcoin's price declining from $65,000 to $55,500 in recent days and OP's relative strength index (RSI) hovering below the midpoint, the token could potentially drop to new all-time lows.Given Bitcoin's current market dominance, going long on OP isn't advisable at this time. While the OP stack features do add value to the Optimism network, it may take a while for the price to recover, especially with the Superchain launch still ahead. However, OP could become a strong contender once Bitcoin Dominance drops below 50%, making it an asset worth watching.Bearish Signs After Failing to Break $2.00?Optimism (OP) has struggled to break above the $2.00 mark against USDT after a brief bounce from its immediate support near $1.22 last July. The rejection came as OP faced multiple resistances around the $2.00 level, including the lower channel line and the 100-day moving average (in blue). This price action was an attempt to re-enter the ascending channel but fell short, suggesting a potential shift towards a bear trend, especially given Bitcoin's current strength and the TOTAL3 index's decline toward $450 billion.Interestingly, the recent drop below the channel line could indicate a market mover's strategy to trigger stop losses, potentially manipulating the price. OP is currently in a one-candle consolidation between $1.22 and $1.86 and is testing the psychological support level at $1.00. However, the relative strength index (RSI) remains below 50, pointing to continued bearish momentum.Can OP Use $1 as a Springboard?\u2023\u00a0 Short-Term:Short-Term:If OP can keep its head above the $1.06 level, we might see another bounce, possibly pushing towards the $2.01 mark where the 100-day moving average is chilling.\u2023\u00a0 Mid-Term: Should OP break above $2.01, the next stop is the resistance level pegged at $2.99. A break here could mark the start of a higher-low structure on the chart, which would be a promising sign that OP might be ready to turn things around.\u2023\u00a0 Long-Term: If OP manages to hold onto the $1.06 mark over a longer period, it could start thinking about challenging its all-time high of $4.86.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

And just when things looked like they couldn\u2019t get any worse, the JOLTS Job Openings report on Wednesday morning missed expectations (7.67M actual vs. 8.09M forecasted), adding fuel to the fire.Now, you\u2019d expect weaker jobs data to send risk assets like stocks and Bitcoin further down, right?

And when the economy sneezes, risk assets tend to catch a cold.Surprise, Surprise: S&P500 Bounces BackBut here\u2019s where things get interesting. Despite all the gloomy signals, the S&P500 pulled a U-turn on Wednesday morning, bouncing back from the $5510 level. It seems that Tuesday\u2019s sell-off was a bit too aggressive, pushing risk assets into oversold territory. Cue a wave of buying that caught most people by surprise.That rally didn\u2019t last long, though. The S&P500 surged up to $5555 before hitting resistance and sliding back to the $5520 zone. Bulls and bears are now locked in a tug-of-war, and if $5520 gives way, we could be looking at a dip to $5482\u2014or even as low as $5400-$5300 in the worst-case scenario.S&P500 1H ChartBitcoin Follows Suit\u2014But Can It Hold?Bitcoin followed a similar script, rebounding from $56.3k to hit $58.5k after the JOLTS data dropped. But here's the catch: it then started to pull back below $58k, raising doubts about the real strength of this rally.It definitely could not hold above $58k, and ran the risk of forming a lower low than the $59.5k high we saw earlier, which opened the door to a drop towards $57k, or even down to $54k if things really fall apart.BTC 1H ChartWhat\u2019s Next?The S&P500 made an unexpected bounce to $5550 following weaker-than-anticipated employment data.Meanwhile, Bitcoin surged to 58.5k but is now struggling to hold above 58k. Failure to reclaim this level could signal trouble ahead.Both the S&P500 and Bitcoin need to sustain these critical levels to avoid deeper declines.But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves\u2014this is a volatile market, and caution is the name of the game, especially if you\u2019re trading with leverage\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

Normally, lower oil prices are great news. Why? Because expensive oil tends to jack up logistics and electricity costs, which stirs up inflation. Cheaper oil? Less inflationary pressure. That might mean central banks can ease off on rate hikes, potentially giving the economy\u2014and risk assets like Bitcoin\u2014a breather.Its recent downturn could stem from various factors, including the rise of alternative energies and increased global supply.

And they\u2019re going all in on institutional adoption \u2014 getting the big players involved.Quant didn\u2019t get here overnight. Once known as \u201cQuant Network AG,\u201d it was laser-focused on connecting different blockchains. But now, they\u2019re eyeing a bigger prize: bringing both crypto and traditional finance together. And that\u2019s a pretty strategic move because if they can get institutions to adopt their tech, it could give Quant a serious edge.Rebranding Quant: Why Should You Care?Quant\u2019s got a new look. They\u2019ve rebranded as \u201cQNT Services AG,\u201d and while that might seem like just a name change, it\u2019s actually a clue about where they're headed. They used to focus on just making blockchains talk to each other \u2014 now, they\u2019re also talking up their own token, QNT. And here's the kicker: they\u2019re introducing token staking. This is a shift toward making the QNT token more useful within their system, which could be a smart play for increasing demand.Will the Rebrand Boost QNT's Price?Against BTC, Since its October 2022 high, QNT has been on a bit of a losing streak, with lower highs and lower lowsPresently, QNT may have not bottomed out yet but it is clear that QNT is out of the major trendline resistance, its next market cycle suggests a potential long term accumulation stage where it undergoes sideways movement. With the rebrand and staking, demand for QNT could see a boost, especially with staking rewards on the table.An interesting area to watch for is at $0.0022 as this marks the lower-high structure and the recent high of QNT/BTC. If it breaks this level, we could see the start of a trend reversal, especially if Bitcoin Dominance drops below 50%. Something to keep an eye on!Is QNT Ready for a Breakout?QNT has been stuck in a wide consolidation range between $40 and $150 for what feels like forever, and its breakout attempt in October 2022 didn\u2019t quite pan out. Right now, the price is hanging around a level that buyers seem to like, based on past behaviour, as shown by the June 2022 consolidation zone (highlighted in green). The chart shows a triangle pattern, which could mean a breakout is coming \u2014 but don\u2019t get too excited yet.Bitcoin still runs the show in the market, and with QNT sitting under its key moving averages (in blue), this might not be the best time to jump in long.Can QNT make a bounce from the $40 level?\u2023\u00a0 Short-Term: If QNT can keep its head above the $41.63 level, we might see a swing towards the $107.98 mark where the 100-day moving average is chilling.\u2023\u00a0 Mid-Term: If it holds the 100-day average at $107.98, the next challenge is the resistance at $148.79. Breaking this could start a new upward trend, which would be a big win for QNT bulls.\u2023\u00a0 Long-Term: If QNT keeps bouncing around $40 and doesn't dip below, it could start aiming for the multi-year high of $192.26 \u2014 a long shot, but not impossible.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

This weaker-than-anticipated job creation in the non-farm sector underscores signs of a slowing U.S. labour market. With this data in hand, the case for a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve gains even more traction.What does that mean for markets? Well, the S&P500 didn\u2019t take the news well. After rejecting the $5640 level earlier this week (thanks to weak Manufacturing PMI data), it\u2019s now inching closer to the crucial $5500 mark. If it dips below that, we could be in for a slide to $5482, $5460, or even $5400. Worst case? We might see $5310. Bulls are hoping to clear the $5640 level for any real bounce, but that seems like a tall order right now.S&P500 1H ChartBitcoin Drops Below 58K: More Pain Ahead?Beyond the S&P500's weak chart performance, the deteriorating employment data is heightening concerns of a potential recession or \u2018hard landing\u2019 after the Fed's aggressive rate hikes. This backdrop increases the likelihood of rate cuts, with their pace hinging on the urgency to revive employment and consumption. Ultimately, these cuts could ignite a \u2018risk on\u2019 scenario, benefiting risk assets like Bitcoin and the broader stock market.After rejecting the $58,220 level overnight on Wednesday the 4th in NY, Bitcoin has dropped to $56,350, weighed down by weak Non-Farm Employment Change data. Well, Bitcoin just crossed a line\u2014literally. It broke the crucial $56.3k support, which isn\u2019t a great sign for bulls. Now that it's below that level, the door is open for declines toward $55.8k. And if the slide continues, we could be staring down further drops to $55.4k, $54k, or even as low as $52.7k.BTC 1H ChartBut hey, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. If Bitcoin manages to hold the line at $56.3k and recover the $57k level, it might be setting up for another shot at the $58k\u2013$59.5k zone. It\u2019s not impossible, but it\u2019s a bit of a long shot given the current market sentiment.What is left for the market?The S&P500 shows weakness around $5500 following weaker-than-expected non-farm payrolls dataBTC's falls are a cause for concern, from 58.2k to 56.3k and 55.8K.More weak employment data could spell trouble for risk assets, including Bitcoin and stocks.The takeaway? It\u2019s a volatile market, and unless you\u2019ve got a crystal ball, caution is your best friend\u2014especially if you\u2019re trading with leverage.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

That might not sound like much, but it\u2019s a red flag\u2014especially when you combine it with declining industrial production in France (-0.5% YoY vs. -0.3% Exp.)\u00a0 and Germany (-2.4% YoY vs. -0.4% Exp.), the two economic heavyweights of the region.With the Fed eyeing a possible rate cut in September, this weaker-than-expected GDP is adding to the fears of a global slowdown. Investors in riskier markets\u2014think the S&P500 and Bitcoin\u2014are feeling the pressure.The debate now is whether the Fed will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points.

Now, you might think a lower CPI is good news, but it actually hints at dwindling consumer demand. The even bigger drop in PPI, driven by a hefty 3% slide in oil, coal, and fuel, suggests that producers are seeing shrinking profit margins. This could lead to job cuts and less investment.So, what\u2019s the takeaway? Falling demand and lower producer prices point to a slowdown in global demand for stuff and energy. This isn\u2019t just bad news for China; it could ripple out to Europe and other exporters, making the global economic growth outlook pretty shaky.In a world where U.S. job creation is already sluggish, and China\u2019s economy might be hitting the brakes, markets could see increased volatility and a drop in risk appetite.

The chart looks pretty bullish, with a breakout from a three-month ascending channel, and that 57% resistance level is right in sight. If the momentum keeps up, we could see BTC dominance climb toward 60% or even 63%. On the flip side, support at 55% is tied to the lower channel line, so if things take a dip, that\u2019s where it might bounce.Now, what about volume? It\u2019s been all over the place, with no clear signals, while the RSI sits neutral\u2014so, no strong overbought or oversold conditions to worry about for now. However, the release of the U.S. jobs report on September 6th gave Bitcoin a quick boost to $57,000 before pulling it back below $54,000. Classic Bitcoin, right?Still, despite the choppiness, the uptrend in BTC dominance looks healthy, staying nicely within that ascending channel. The market\u2019s looking for its next big catalyst to drive prices higher. The excitement around spot Bitcoin ETFs in January and April\u2019s Bitcoin halving event is starting to wear off, so everyone\u2019s waiting for the next big thing.Is Bitcoin Headed for a Breakout or Breakdown?The BTC/USDT weekly chart is giving off some bearish vibes right now. Bitcoin is trading near the lower boundary of a descending channel, and it\u2019s 18% below its all-time high. Not exactly the stuff of a bull run. The 20-week SMA (in red) is hovering above the 50-week SMA (in blue), with the candles sandwiched in between. This signals a bearish crossover, while the 100-week SMA sits below the current price, offering some long-term support.One thing worth keeping an eye on is the declining volume, which could mean momentum is fading. The RSI is at 44.51, suggesting neutral to slightly bearish conditions. But before you start ringing the alarm bells, there\u2019s a potential bullish scenario: the price is sitting on two important support levels. The lower channel line coincides with the 50-week moving average, and the 50-week SMA tends to act as a safety net for mid-term holders. So, a bounce here wouldn\u2019t be out of the question.In short, while the BTC/USDT pair may be struggling with bearish pressures, the shift in dominance tells us that Bitcoin is becoming the market\u2019s safe haven. Investors may be consolidating into Bitcoin, anticipating more volatility in altcoins\u2014a signal that Bitcoin\u2019s market influence is growing, even in a broader market downturn.AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

This decline mirrored the broader stock market trend, where the S&P500 dropped over 4.4% due to unclear U.S. labour market data. The index tested $5400 but failed to hold, rejecting it upwards early Monday.The S&P500's recent performance shows it forming a lower high by rejecting $5640 and a higher low. This setup suggests we should brace for increased market volatility in the coming weeks.ETF Flows: The Influx and the Exodus\u2023WeeklyTotal Net Outflows:-$706.19M\u2023Total Net Assets:48.24BChina\u2019s Data Signals Growing Economic WoesChina\u2019s recent PPI and CPI figures, both coming in below expectations, highlight a deepening weakness in the country\u2019s economy and raise recession fears. This situation could spell trouble for the global economy, as a sluggish U.S. labour market combined with China\u2019s recession risks may lead to increased outflows from risk assets like Bitcoin and its ETFs.Most Affected ETFs on Friday, September 6th:\u2023 FBTC (CBOE - Fidelity):-$85.52M outflow, catching eyes as it ranks second in terms of critical mass of capital.\u2023GBTC (NYSE - Grayscale):-$52.87M outflow, underlining the weakness of investor confidence in this fund for Bitcoin ETFs.Top Performing ETF on Friday, September 6th:\u2023IBIT (NASDAQ - BlackRock):$0.00M inflow, still reigning as the most widely adopted ETF in the market.Even with the week\u2019s net outflows, Bitcoin ETFs have seen $16.89B in total inflows since their inception, bringing their total value to around $48.24B\u2014roughly 4.62% of Bitcoin\u2019s market cap.It\u2019s worth noting that total net assets in Bitcoin ETFs have dipped to levels not seen since late February when they were just under $50B. Back then, the trend was upward with capital inflows, but now the movement is heading the other way, indicating a shift toward outflows.BTC on the Radar: Trend AnalysisBTC 1H Chart\u2023Price Correlation:Bitcoin took a nosedive on Friday, September 6, after unclear labour market data, falling sharply from 57k to 52.7k and ending the day with a nearly 4% loss. However, with strong oversold conditions from Friday, a rebound kicked in over the weekend and continued into Monday, recently touching 55k.\u2023Sentiment Analysis:Given the strong oversold conditions on Friday, over the weekend and so far on Monday we are seeing a rebound which recently touched 55k.Should it manage to break 56k with a 1H candlestick body, it could continue the rebound towards 57k-58.2k in the short term, but given the correlation with the S&P500, the rebound should continue on the latter as well.Peeking Into the Future: What's Next?\u2023Upcoming Trends:Current trends reveal significant volatility for Bitcoin and its ETFs. August\u2019s mixed U.S. labour market data, disappointing Chinese activity figures, and a weaker-than-expected Eurozone GDP all point to a slowing global economy. This broader economic uncertainty is impacting not just the S&P500 and alternative indices, but Bitcoin as well.\u2023Investor Implications:Given Bitcoin's sharp declines on Thursday and Friday last week, today\u2019s outlook suggests a continuation of the bullish bounce due to the strong oversold conditions. In the short term, Bitcoin needs to reclaim at least the $58k level and aim for $60k to bolster its chances of a sustained recovery. With Bitcoin\u2019s increasing positive correlation to the S&P500, it\u2019s crucial that the S&P500 also maintains its rebound phase and eventually breaks through its highs to reach new levels.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

The idea? To reshape the tokenization of financial assets and enable smoother, more efficient interactions across blockchains. With NEAR\u2019s scalable, user-friendly platform, the integration could position the protocol as a key player in the growing digital finance space.This buzz around Libre has already given NEAR a short-term price boost, reflecting the rising confidence among investors. The possibility of more liquidity and easier access to tokenized assets might even stabilize or lift NEAR\u2019s price further, potentially pulling in more users and developers. So, what we\u2019re looking at here is the chance for NEAR to strengthen its position, not just in terms of price, but also as a platform for institutional interest.Is NEAR/BTC Heading for a Deeper Decline?The NEAR/BTC pair hasn\u2019t been having the best time, trapped in a long-term downtrend marked by lower highs and lower lows. The trendline doesn\u2019t lie\u2014there\u2019s resistance from both the short- and long-term moving averages, and that\u2019s been keeping NEAR stuck in this pattern. There\u2019s a green demand zone offering support, where the price has bounced before, but with declining trading volume, it looks like NEAR might just consolidate in this area for now.There\u2019s also a bearish divergence in the RSI\u2014the price is falling, but RSI is rising, which suggests the bulls aren\u2019t quite in charge yet. That divergence could mean more weakness ahead, increasing the likelihood of the downtrend continuing.But here\u2019s the twist: NEAR is currently attempting another breakout, hovering just outside the trendline. If this breakout is successful, we could see a reversal of the bearish momentum, especially if Libre\u2019s integration manages to stir up more positive sentiment. If the price can push above both the 50-week and 100-week moving averages, we might be looking at a solid bullish breakout.Will NEAR Hold $3.98 or Drop Further?Right now,NEARis trading around$3.98, bouncing off a key demand zone (highlighted in green) that suggests some support. But there\u2019s still the 50-week moving average acting as tough resistance, which aligns with other price barriers, making upward momentum a bit of a challenge.If NEAR breaks above that 50-week moving average, it could signal the start of a bullish trend. But if it falls below the demand zone, further downside might be on the cards. The good news? NEAR has the 100-week moving average and the previous breakout zone (pegged at $3.00) offering support, so a complete collapse seems unlikely.A bounce to occur?\u2023 Short-Term: If NEAR holds above$3.07, we could see a swing up to$5.49, where the 20-week moving average is currently hanging out.\u2023 Mid-Term: If NEAR can break and hold above$5.49, it might rise to$6.70, the middle of its range between$4.29and$9.00, where it could face some resistance.\u2023 Long-Term: If NEAR manages to clear$4.40\u2014the level where the 50-week moving average hovers\u2014it could potentially climb to$8.23over the long haul.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

The story here partly revolves around the sharp drop in gas revenue, thanks to the collapse of the memecoin bubble and stiff competition from platforms like Tron, which offers cheaper fees.And then there\u2019s the looming regulatory cloud: the SEC is looking at Solana and thinking, \"Hey, maybe this is a security.\" That\u2019s not great news for liquidity or investor interest. On the bright side, Solana is trying to pivot with projects like Firedancer, aimed at improving performance and decentralization. But even with these efforts, it\u2019s a tricky path ahead, especially if Solana wants to keep a strong footing in DeFi, gaming, and NFTs.Will SOL/BTC Break Out or Face a Bull Trap?The SOL/BTC pair is at a critical juncture, testing resistance at its March 2022 high. It tried to break through but didn\u2019t quite make it, raising the possibility of a bull trap. Right now, the price is consolidating in a single candle range from $0.0016 to $0.0026, signaling indecision in the market.The good news is that SOL/BTC is still moving within an ascending channel, which suggests there\u2019s an uptrend in place. Short- and long-term moving averages are acting as dynamic support and resistance, but that recent volume spike during the failed breakout shows there\u2019s interest\u2014just not enough follow-through.Technically speaking, a bounce looks possible in the short term, especially as the price is close to the 50-week moving average and the lower channel line is offering support. If Firedancer and some regulatory clarity kick in, we could see a recovery. But for now, the market\u2019s keeping a close eye on how Solana navigates these challenges.Will Solana Break Free from Its Descending Channel?On the SOL/USDT weekly chart, key resistance sits between $200 and $225, a zone Solana has struggled to break through. Support is hanging out between $75 and $100, where there\u2019s been buying interest in the past.Right now, Solana is trading below the 50-week moving average, which reinforces its bearish trend, while hovering near the 100-week moving average, a key pivot point. The price is still stuck in a descending channel, which suggests the bears aren\u2019t done yet. With the RSI sitting below 50, there\u2019s still some room for more downside.If Solana breaks below its support zone, things could get uglier. But if it manages to break above resistance, we could see a potential reversal. Keep an eye on those descending channel lines, because they\u2019ll be crucial for what happens next.Will the 50-Week Moving Average Hold?\u2023\u00a0 Short-Term:The 50-week moving average should provide support around $110, and if it holds, the price could swing up to $162, where the 20-week average is lurking.\u2023 Mid-Term:If Solana stays above the 20-week moving average, it could push toward $184.\u2023 Long-Term:If Solana keeps moving inside the channel, a breakout could eventually take it to $200.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

This change would indicate that there could be upside volatility in the near term as the price is currently around 57k.Selling Wall:\u2023 Immediate Bearish Zone:Between $56,400 - $55,500.\u2023 Insights:To the bearish side, there is mild support starting from $56,400 and extending to 55k, with minor blocks of liquidity in the $54,700-$53,800 and $53,500-$52,800 zones. Should these supports be broken to the downside, the strongest liquidity zone lies between $52,500 and $51,000.Liquidity Secrets UnveiledBullish Side:Bitcoin is showing strong momentum towards the $58,300 mark. This area is packed with liquidity, stretching from $58,600 to $59,000, making it a critical zone to watch. If Bitcoin hits this range, we\u2019ll need to closely monitor the price action to see if it pushes higher or if it turns into a classic bull trap, where optimism quickly reverses into a sell-off.Bearish Side:Conversely, on the downside, things look a bit different. Immediate liquidity is sparse, which could increase the chances of Bitcoin retracing to its recent low around $52,400 if it starts heading south. In this scenario, a bearish move could gain traction faster, as the path down is less obstructed, setting the stage for a potential deeper dip.Trading Tactics\u2023 Long Position:Breaking the immediate resistance at $57,500 would give it more upside probability so this would be a good entry at least up to the $58,300 area mentioned above.\u2023 Short Position:Breaking through the $56,300 support would more likely take it towards $56,000 - $54,650.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

But despite all the promise, the market\u2019s been a bit lukewarm. POL dropped from $0.40 to $0.37 right after the announcement, then found some footing around $0.38.

They\u2019re aiming to launch an Ethereum ETF on Cboe Australia, potentially giving investors a regulated way to invest in Ethereum using either cash or the cryptocurrency itself. Sounds pretty straightforward, but the implications could be huge.Here\u2019s why: ETF approvals tend to inject some serious confidence into the market. If Bitcoin ETFs have taught us anything, it's that once these products go live, demand spikes and prices often follow. A regulated ETF could also boost Ethereum's liquidity, which could help smooth out some of the typical volatility we\u2019ve come to expect from crypto. In the long run, this could further establish Ethereum as a legitimate asset in the eyes of traditional finance.Monochrome, in partnership with Vasco Trustees, submitted the application, and they\u2019re hoping for approval by the end of September 2024. If all goes well, we could see the IETH ticker on major brokerage platforms around the same time. For retail investors, this ETF would be a simple, regulated way to get exposure to Ethereum, helping bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance.Will an Ethereum ETF Shift the ETH/BTC Balance?Take a glance at the ETH/BTC chart, and you\u2019ll notice it's not exactly sunshine and rainbows. We\u2019ve got a downtrend with lower highs and lower lows, all within a descending channel. The 100-day moving average (in purple) and some tough resistance levels (box highlighted in red) are making any upward move an uphill battle. On the flip side, there's a lower boundary providing some support, but buyers aren't exactly rushing in.With volume thinning out, it\u2019s clear momentum is slowing. The RSI? It\u2019s below the midline but not quite screaming \"oversold.\" So, while there's still room for a further slide, we're not in panic mode just yet. The bears are in control for now, but any major news, like an ETF approval, could spark a reversal and shake things up.Can Ethereum Crack $2,800?Ethereum is hovering around $2,352, and it's got its work cut out for it. Resistance is looming at the 50-day moving average, and what used to be a strong support has now flipped into resistance. But it's not all doom and gloom\u2014the 100-week moving average is stepping in as a potential safety net.There\u2019s a bearish divergence on the RSI, signalling that ETH\u2019s recent push higher might be losing steam. The ETF buzz could be just what Ethereum needs to break through resistance at the 50-week moving average but don\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s some turbulence along the way. If the ETF news plays out positively, we could see Ethereum break new ground, though it\u2019ll likely be a bumpy ride.Can ETH Hold the Line and Push Higher?\u2023 Short-Term: If ETH can hold above $2,212, we might see it push toward $3,079, where the 20-week moving average is hanging out.\u2023 Mid-Term: A break past $3,079 could clear the path to $3,886.\u2023 Long-Term: If Ethereum maintains its ground at $2,212, it might just challenge its all-time high near $4,628.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

We\u2019ve been riding waves of volatility kicked off by murky U.S. labour market data, plus some not-so-great signals from the Eurozone and China hinting at an economic slowdown. Now, all eyes are on Wednesday, September 11th, when the U.S. releases August CPI data. The forecast? A modest 0.2% month-over-month increase, which brings the annual figure to 2.6%.Here\u2019s the kicker: the focus has shifted from inflation to the risk of a 'hard landing'\u2014where both the job market and the economy start to struggle. If the CPI comes in higher than 0.2%, it could mean the economy still has some strength. But that might also make the Fed rethink cutting interest rates, which could dampen investor optimism and cause the stock market to waver. On the other hand, if the CPI stays low or drops, it might please those hoping for rate cuts, but it could also signal that the economy is slowing down too much. It\u2019s a balancing act between 'inflation is under control' and 'we might have bigger problems ahead.S&P500 4H ChartIn this context, get ready for potential rollercoaster action in the S&P500 and Bitcoin., especially since the market hasn\u2019t seen a rate cut since 2019. Volatile data points could trigger wild swings in both. The S&P500 recently bounced off the $5400 level\u2014a good sign for bulls, and if it can crack $5556, then the next pit stop is at $5640 and maybe even new highs.Bitcoin's Wild Ride in a Chaotic SeptemberBitcoin, ever the volatile champ, has had an interesting rebound to the upside closely shadowing the stock market. The recent bounce from 52.7k shows that there might be a continuation if it holds the 57k level and heads towards 58.2k and 60k if the latter resistance is broken, as long as the stock market stays upbeat post-CPI.But if Bitcoin can\u2019t break past that $58.2k resistance, watch out\u2014a bearish setup could drag it back down to $54k or worse, especially if the S&P500 falters.BTC 4H ChartWhat is left for the market?The S&P500 managed to reject the $5400 level, which would give better bullish probabilities.Bitcoin rejected the 53k area on the upside and continues to maintain the rebound.The CPI would be definitive data to understand if the market is going to a soft landing or not, which would positively affect both the S&P500 and Bitcoin.Stay cautious\u2014it\u2019s a wild market out there, especially if you\u2019re playing with leverage.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

Against this backdrop, all eyes are on the European Central Bank's Main Refinancing Rate announcement on Thursday. This rate dictates the cost for commercial banks borrowing from the ECB, and a 25 basis points cut is widely expected. However, the real drama lies in the ECB's internal debate: Is the economic slowdown enough to ease inflation fears, or is the hawkish stance still in play? While inflation is nearing the 2% sweet spot, core inflation, particularly in services, is proving stubbornly high.A rate cut could weaken the Euro, boosting the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) until the anticipated U.S. rate cut\u2014also expected in September\u2014starts to take effect. Markets have already priced in the U.S. cut, so the real kicker will be its size: a 25bps cut could signal Fed confidence in economic resilience, while a 50bps cut might scream concern about the labour market and recession fears.EXY 4H ChartThe Euro Index (EXY) is at the upper end of its range from late 2022. A dip below 110.6 could send it sliding to the lower bounds, and breaching 104.6 might push it closer to 100 in the short term, emphasizing the Euro's weakness.DXY 4H ChartThe DXY is still bouncing around the historical support of 100, which might serve as a floor if confidence in the US economic strength picks up. If sentiment improves, we could see the index rally from this level towards 103-105 in the short term. A drop below the critical 100 mark would be troubling for the dollar, but a faltering Euro could keep it above this threshold. As we are entering a rate-cutting phase aimed at reviving growth, the U.S. dollar could face downward pressure. However, the interplay between rate cuts and U.S. economic health will ultimately steer the DXY's direction and the dollar\u2019s global standing.Will Bitcoin benefit from a BCE Rate Cut?A rate cut from the ECB could have interesting ripple effects on Bitcoin, as it might drive investors to seek alternative assets in a lower-interest environment. If the rate cut weakens the Euro, pushing the DXY higher, this could initially put pressure on Bitcoin, given its increasing correlation with risk assets.However, the prospect of looser monetary policy often stirs hopes for a more favourable landscape for riskier bets, like Bitcoin, as traditional assets yield less. In essence, a rate cut signals central banks\u2019 willingness to prop up slowing economies, and this \"easy money\" environment might eventually boost appetite for Bitcoin, especially if investors start looking for higher returns or a hedge against fiat devaluation.Is Bitcoin Ready to Rally Above $60K?BTC 4H ChartBitcoin is riding a bullish rebound after forming a higher low at $52.7k\u2014its first since late February\u2014which could set the stage for more upside in the short term. This newfound structure hints at potential gains if macroeconomic conditions stay favourable.Should the positive momentum persist, Bitcoin could break through the $57k - $58.2k resistance levels, paving the way for a rally toward the $60k - $62k range. With the right market tailwinds, this bounce might gather enough steam to push BTC higher, reflecting renewed investor confidence and a shift in sentiment after months of cautious trading.What is left for the market?The ECB is set to cut interest rates as the Eurozone economy weakens.This move could strengthen the DXY, at least until the anticipated Fed rate cut.Bitcoin might see a boost from a renewed \"risk-on\" sentiment in major global markets.Stay cautious\u2014it\u2019s a wild market out there, especially if you\u2019re playing with leverage.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

The idea is simple: users can earn tokens by playing the games they already love, or by trying out new games through campaigns on the PERPLAY app. It\u2019s basically a game-focused advertising platform that\u2019s supercharged with token rewards.Now, Arbitrum has had a rough ride lately. Prices have been on a steady downtrend, so the big question is: will PERPLAY\u2019s integration change that? Theoretically, this partnership could boost demand for Arbitrum as more users come into its ecosystem through PERPLAY\u2019s GameFi setup. More users could mean more buying pressure, which might help push Arbitrum\u2019s price. Both platforms are betting on the growing Web3 gaming world, and if they play their cards right, this partnership could lead to long-term price growth for Arbitrum.Is ARB/BTC Set for a Reversal After Big Losses?The ARB/BTC trading pair has taken a beating. It\u2019s down 82.47% from its peak, and the weekly chart is showing a clear downtrend with lower highs and lower lows\u2014classic bearish behaviour. Short-term moving averages are sitting below long-term ones, which isn\u2019t a great sign, and trading volume has been inconsistent but mostly dropping. All this points to weak market interest.However, the RSI is giving a glimmer of hope\u2014it\u2019s in oversold territory. That means there might be room for a price bounce, though the overall trend remains bearish, so don\u2019t get too excited just yet. A reversal could be in the cards, but it\u2019s worth being cautious.Adding a layer to this technical picture, PERPLAY\u2019s recent integration with Arbitrum could introduce fresh buying pressure into the ecosystem. While this partnership may not immediately reverse the downtrend, it\u2019s worth noting that a growing user base from PERPLAY\u2019s Game&Earn platform could increase demand for Arbitrum tokens over the medium to long term. This boost in demand, paired with the current oversold RSI, sets the stage for a potential recovery.In the short term, ARB/BTC may still face challenges with bearish indicators in play. However, the PERPLAY partnership could provide long-term growth potential by driving demand for Arbitrum\u2019s ecosystem, which may gradually shift the momentum and lead to a price reversal over time.Can ARB Break Free from the Downtrend?Arbitrum\u2019s (ARB) USD chart isn\u2019t looking much better. There\u2019s resistance everywhere\u2014the 20-week SMA, the previous all-time low at $0.7546, and the upper boundary of a descending channel are all blocking upward movement.However, PERPLAY\u2019s recent integration with Arbitrum could provide a much-needed catalyst. As more users engage with the Game&Earn platform, increased demand for Arbitrum\u2019s ecosystem could gradually help alleviate selling pressure. While the RSI is nearing oversold territory, signalling some potential for a rebound, ARB must overcome these resistance levels to turn this partnership into a tangible price recovery in the medium term.Title: How Long Can ARB Stay Down?\u2023 Short-Term: If ARB can bounce off $0.4280, it might rise to $0.7754, where the 20-day moving average sits.\u2023 Mid-Term: A break above $0.7754 could trigger a broader reversal, targeting $1.1750.\u2023 Long-Term: If ARB holds steady above $0.4280, it could aim for $1.68 down the road.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

This is the kind of thing that gets traders buzzing about a potential bullish reversal, especially now that XRP is comfortably above key moving averages. But there's a catch: volume is still low, which suggests the market is waiting for something to really light the fire.Enter Ripple\u2019s partnership with Futureverse, a company building Web3 apps and AI-powered tools. Ripple\u2019s custody solution is basically the high-tech vault Futureverse needs to lock down assets in the metaverse. Think of it like adding a state-of-the-art security system to your virtual mansion.This collaboration could be a game-changer. With digital asset custody projected to hit $10 trillion by 2030, Ripple\u2019s involvement boosts XRP\u2019s utility in a big way. And it\u2019s not just theory\u2014the partnership has already sparked a 4% jump in XRP\u2019s price. As Ripple keeps building these strategic alliances, don\u2019t be surprised if XRP\u2019s momentum continues to climb.XRP/BTC: Bounce or More Pain?XRP/BTC is hanging out in a range between 0.00000619 BTC and 0.00000901 BTC, hovering just above a key support level that\u2019s been tested more times than we'd like to count. The 20-week SMA is creeping up just under the 50-week SMA, hinting that a bullish crossover could be on the horizon. But, of course, the market needs a little more excitement\u2014volatility is low, and the price action feels like it's stuck in limbo.Ripple's partnership with Futureverse could be the catalyst that injects the needed excitement into the XRP/BTC pair. By enhancing XRP's utility in the burgeoning metaverse and Web3 space, the collaboration has the potential to attract new investors and increase demand for XRP. This strategic move aligns with the projection that digital asset custody could hit $10 trillion by 2030, positioning XRP favorably for long-term growth.The RSI is sitting in neutral territory, just over 50, so the market is undecided\u2014everyone\u2019s waiting to see if buyers will step up or if this thing is going to drift lower. In short, XRP/BTC is at a tipping point, and the next move could be significant, especially if volume starts to pick up in response to positive fundamental developments like the Futureverse partnership. Now, here\u2019s the thing: 0.00000619 BTC is the level to watch. It's the floor that\u2019s held up so far, but if it breaks, we might see some trouble.XRP/USD Breaks Free: Is a Bullish Reversal on the Horizon?XRP/USD just pulled off something noteworthy\u2014it broke out of a long-term descending trendline. That\u2019s a big deal because it signals that the bearish grip might be loosening, and momentum could be shifting. Right now, XRP is chilling in a consolidation zone between $0.4699 and $0.7500, so we\u2019re not seeing fireworks yet, but things are definitely looking up.To boost this potential bullish reversal, we have Ripple\u2019s custody solution, which provides the high-tech vault Futureverse needs to safeguard assets in the metaverse, significantly increasing the utility of XRP. This collaboration could be a turning point for XRP. The partnership has already triggered a 4% rise in XRP's price, and as Ripple continues to build strategic alliances, XRP's momentum could keep growing.The price is now floating above both the 20-week and 100-week moving averages, which is like a thumbs-up from the technicals. Add to that the fact that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is sitting comfortably above 50, and it starts to look like XRP might be gearing up for a move higher. There's strong support down at $0.2907, which has been battle-tested a few times\u2014but luckily, XRP is far from that danger zone for now.The key? Volume. We need to see some excitement in the market to push XRP through resistance levels. If buyers come in and the volume picks up\u2014perhaps spurred by positive news like the Futureverse partnership\u2014we could be looking at a bullish reversal. Keep an eye on how it moves in the next few candles\u2014this could get interesting.Can XRP Use the Trendline as a Springboard?\u2023\u00a0 Short-Term: If XRP stays above $0.38334, it could push towards $0.7444, testing the upper range.\u2023\u00a0 Mid-Term: Breaking $0.7444 might set the stage for a move to $0.9270 and start forming a higher-low structure.\u2023\u00a0 Long-Term: If XRP holds above $0.7444, $1 could be back on the table.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

That\u2019s a decent drop from the previous 2.9%, and it\u2019s got everyone buzzing about a potential 50bps rate cut coming in September. With inflation cooling off, the Fed\u2019s attention is shifting away from price stability and turning to employment and the overall health of the economy. Translation: we might be in for a monetary easing cycle soon.So what does this mean for the markets? Well, rate cuts are usually music to the ears of risk assets like the S&P 500 and Bitcoin. When interest rates fall, there\u2019s less incentive to stick with boring fixed-income investments, and traders start hunting for bigger returns in equities and crypto. On top of that, cheaper financing costs make companies more profitable, which can drive stock prices even higher, adding fuel to market rallies.But, What\u2019s Next?

This initial drop might have been a move to shake out leveraged positions before a potential rebound.If the S&P500 can recover the $5450 level and push past $5500, we might be looking at a confirmed bounce back, with a strong chance of reaching the $5550 - $5640 range. Keep an eye on these levels; they\u2019ll signal whether the market is gearing up for a more sustained recovery.Bitcoin's Reaction: Could CPI Fuel Its Rally?With inflation trends cooling off, a more favourable backdrop for risk assets, including Bitcoin, seems likely. However, the market has priced in a 25bps rate cut, so any surprise move to 50bps might spook investors, possibly causing some bearish volatility.Bitcoin\u2019s recent action saw it test and then reclaim the $57k level after an initial dip to $55.5k. If it can push through $57k, we might see it challenge $58.2k - $60k soon. The next target? Revisiting the reversal zone near $62k - $65.5k.BTC 4H ChartWhat is left for the market?The CPI came out in line with expectations, which would give more strength to a rate cut scenario and Risk On for risky assets.The S&P had a sweep to $5400 and Bitcoin also to 55.5k.Should the S&P break $5500 and Bitcoin break 57k, there would be a greater likelihood of both going higher.Stay cautious\u2014it\u2019s a wild market out there, especially if you\u2019re playing with leverage.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

Not a shocker\u2014recession fears have been in the air for months, and Europe\u2019s struggling with sluggish GDP and stubborn inflation that just won\u2019t quit.Sure, this rate cut might pump some life into the Eurozone economy, but it\u2019s a classic double-edged sword.

Spark interbank lending by leaning on the deposit rate for now. But if liquidity tightens up, banks might be forced to borrow from the ECB again, putting the refinancing rate back in the spotlight.EXY 4H ChartMeanwhile, the Euro (EXY) isn\u2019t looking too strong, hanging below 110.6, and if economic data keeps disappointing, the Euro could weaken even further.DXY 4H ChartAcross the Pond: U.S. Markets on EdgeIn the U.S., the Dollar Index (DXY) is hovering around 101.6, and the latest jobless claims came in higher than expected (230k vs. 227k).

But in true Bitcoin fashion, it didn\u2019t stay down for long, bouncing back up to the 58.2k area, which just so happens to mark the edge of the reversal zone from its last high.Now, here\u2019s where things get spicy: Before this big sweep, Bitcoin took a little dip, seemingly linked to Donald Trump\u2019s lacklustre showing in Tuesday night\u2019s debate.

The initial market reaction was predictable: bearish volatility hit the S&P 500, sending it into a dip. But, by midday, the index clawed its way back above the $5560 mark, highlighting a market that's struggling to find its footing amid growing uncertainty.The Tug of War at $5500-$5600Right now, we\u2019re seeing a classic market standoff around the $5500-$5600 level. It\u2019s a battleground where bulls and bears are wrestling for control. This price range is pivotal because it represents a key support and resistance zone that could determine the near-term direction of the S&P 500. With the market already pricing in a September rate cut, eyes are glued to these levels as investors weigh the potential impact of central bank actions.S&P500 4H ChartRate Cut Dilemma: 25bps or 50bps?The big question for September is whether the Federal Reserve will opt for a 25bps or a more aggressive 50bps rate cut. A 50bps cut might signal a desperate move to stave off a recession, potentially spooking markets and leading to a short-term bearish reaction. Conversely, if the cut is perceived as a move to encourage risk-taking and investment, it could drive a bullish rally. Investors are on edge, watching the Fed's next move closely, as recent rate cuts (except the first one in 2019) have often triggered corrections in risk assets.Bitcoin's Balancing Act: Will It Break Higher?Bitcoin faced resistance at the $58.2k level following the latest Jobless Claims report, showing the broader market's sensitivity to economic data. By midday Thursday, BTC hadn't slipped below $57k, which might be the first signal of a sustained bullish bounce. This resilience hints at a market that's cautious but not ready to give up on its upward trajectory just yet.Wednesday was a mixed bag for Bitcoin. Despite an annualized CPI coming in at 2.5%, aligning with expectations and triggering a positive market response, Bitcoin's early performance was marred by a dip after Donald Trump's weak showing in Tuesday night's debate. This brief bearish move seemed like a perfect setup for BTC to trap short positions, sweeping down to $55.5k before clawing back to the $57k area and pushing up to $58.2k. It was a classic Bitcoin move\u2014catching traders off guard before shifting gears.BTC 4H ChartThe big question now is whether Bitcoin can break through the $58.2k resistance. If it does, a run to $60k seems increasingly likely in the short term. However, failure to hold above $57k could see a retreat back to $55.5k, and possibly further down to the $54k-$51.7k range. It's a classic fork in the road for Bitcoin, with both bulls and bears ready to pounce depending on which level breaks first.What is left for the market?Jobless Claims came out slightly higher than expected, to which the S&P500 responded with bearish volatility to recover by midday.Bitcoin in turn lost 58.2k but failed to test 57k, which in principle would indicate bullish strength.Should the S&P500 hold the $5500 area, the markets are more likely to be bullish.Stay cautious\u2014it\u2019s a wild market out there, especially if you\u2019re playing with leverage.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

This partnership, unveiled on September 10th, aims to supercharge VELO's USDV stablecoin by backing it with BlackRock\u2019s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). Sounds promising, right? Well, despite the fanfare, VELO\u2019s price took a hit, dropping over 22% in the past day. This drop is a textbook example of \u201csell the news\u201d\u2014where initial excitement turns into a sell-off as speculators cash in on recent gains. It\u2019s a familiar pattern, seen with other crypto projects like Ondo Finance and Injective, which also leveraged BlackRock\u2019s fund for added appeal and yield.So, while VELO\u2019s move looks smart, the market\u2019s reaction reminds us that news doesn\u2019t always guarantee a price uptick.However, after a few days, VELO is now recovering and potentially continues its base building while it also starts to bend the trend which is an early sign of reversal.VELO\u2019s Symmetrical Triangle: What\u2019s Next for the Price?The VELO/BTC chart is setting the stage for some exciting action with a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern, marked by converging trendlines, shows VELO consolidating before it makes a move. The upper trendline, linking a series of lower highs, represents stiff resistance, while the lower trendline, connecting higher lows, marks strong support. As VELO's price squeezes towards the triangle\u2019s point, a breakout is looming. Watch for key levels: resistance at around 0.00000038 and support at 0.000000087. If VELO breaks above resistance, it could signal a bullish surge; if it falls below support, we might see bearish pressure.Adding to the drama, VELO\u2019s recent partnership with BlackRock could be a game-changer. By boosting the USDV stablecoin with BlackRock\u2019s fund, VELO aims to enhance its appeal and credibility. This move fits into a larger trend of tokenization in finance, potentially attracting more institutional interest and cementing VELO\u2019s place in the financial ecosystem.VELO\u2019s Price Action: Bullish Bounce or Bearish Trap?VELO/USDT is currently priced at around $0.0149, having taken a nosedive from its previous highs and now settling into these lower ranges. The moving averages paint a somewhat optimistic picture: the 20-week SMA sits at $0.0138551, and VELO is comfortably above it, as well as above the 50-week (in green) and 100-week (in purple) SMAs. This setup hints at some bullish momentum, suggesting that upward movement might be on the horizon. The RSI is at 56.03, indicating a balanced market\u2014neither overbought nor oversold.Yet, the long-term trend still leans bearish, with the moving averages sloping downward. The recent \"sell the news\" phenomenon, following VELO\u2019s integration with BlackRock\u2019s tokenized fund, saw the price plummet over 22% in just 24 hours. This suggests that while the announcement sparked initial interest, many investors (the short-term) chose to cash in on recent gains.To flip the script and signal a bullish reversal, VELO needs to break above the $0.02 level or escape its current consolidation zone. Watch these key levels\u2014VELO\u2019s next moves will be crucial in determining whether it\u2019s set for a rebound or more declines."}]}

If you're thinking, \"That's a mouthful,\" you're right\u2014but it\u2019s also kind of a big deal.Adding something like BlackRock\u2019s BUIDL fund gives USDV more stability, which is crucial for its role in Velo\u2019s payment and trading platforms.

President Christine Lagarde's latest press conference was a masterclass in ambiguity. While the rate cut was very much on the cards, Lagarde kept the markets guessing with a \"wait-and-see\" game plan.

In other words, the Eurozone is cooling off, and Lagarde isn't rushing to turn up the heat.Now, here\u2019s the kicker: the ECB's data-dependent mantra means they're not locking in any rate path.

That\u2019s a pretty strong bet that the ECB is going to sit tight, at least for now. But Lagarde's emphasis on flexibility isn't just a buzzword\u2014it's a nod to the unpredictable forces at play: weak exports, geopolitical wildcards, and the delayed impact of previous rate hikes.What's Next for the Euro? A Tough Road AheadSo, what does this all mean for the Euro? Well, Lagarde\u2019s flexible stance signals that any further rate cuts will be gradual and carefully timed. We might see another 25bps trim in December but don\u2019t hold your breath for anything more aggressive this year. It\u2019s clear that the ECB isn\u2019t ready to throw caution to the wind. For the Euro to stage a real comeback, we\u2019ll need more than just a promise of flexibility\u2014we\u2019ll need tangible signs of economic revival. Until then, the Euro\u2019s path forward is fraught with uncertainty, and Lagarde's \"flexible outlook\" may be more of a balancing act than a bold recovery strategy.EXY 4H ChartThe market's love affair with central bank speeches and rate cuts is as volatile as ever, and Thursday's action was no exception. The EXY (Euro Index) kicked off the day with some pep in its step, bouncing back from the 110 mark. This little boost came thanks to ECB President Christine Lagarde's carefully balanced tone, which, while acknowledging the economic slowdown, didn't sound as dovish as some had feared. Suddenly, the Euro looked less like a sinking ship and more like a cautious comeback story. Traders are eyeing the 111.6 level; breaking through that could set the stage for a push towards 112.8, signalling a potential short-term rally for the Euro.The Dollar Dilemma: When the Fed Out-Doves the ECBMeanwhile, over in dollar land, things are playing out in a way that seems almost counterintuitive. You'd think a rate cut in Europe would make the Euro less attractive, right? But not so fast. The DXY (Dollar Index) continued its downward spiral, slipping past its recent resistance at 101.83 and heading toward the next support at 100.64. The culprit? Market sentiment that the Fed might be even more aggressive in cutting rates compared to the ECB. It's a classic case of, \"Who's the bigger dove?\" and right now, the Fed looks set to win that title. The perception of a faster rate-cutting path in the U.S. is making the dollar lose its shine, nudging the DXY lower.DXY 4H ChartThe Fed vs. ECB: Rate Cuts and Market MovesSo, where does this leave us? In a word: uncertain. Lagarde\u2019s ECB isn\u2019t exactly screaming \u201cfull steam ahead\u201d on rate cuts, but the Fed seems ready to dive in headfirst to stave off a potential recession. This divergence is key. The Euro might get some short-term gains if it breaks through those technical levels, but the bigger picture is all about central bank policy direction. The Fed\u2019s perceived eagerness to cut could keep the dollar on the back foot, making every ECB move\u2014no matter how subtle\u2014feel like a potential pivot point. As always, in the world of central banks, it\u2019s not just what they do\u2014it\u2019s how the market thinks they\u2019re going to do it next. And right now, it\u2019s all eyes on the data, the speeches, and, of course, the charts.Bitcoin\u2019s Quiet Thursday Amid Key Economic EventsThursday saw Bitcoin experiencing relatively low volatility, despite a flurry of significant economic data. The markets were abuzz not only with the ECB\u2019s rate cut and Christine Lagarde\u2019s remarks but also with the latest PPI data and the weekly US Unemployment Claims report, which came in slightly above expectations. This data hints at a bit of weakness in the labour market\u2014something the Fed is likely keen to address with a planned 25bps rate cut starting in September, as anticipated by the markets.In the broader context, the \u2018risk-on\u2019 environment appears to be gaining traction, which should, in theory, be beneficial for Bitcoin and other risk assets in the short term, especially as the DXY weakens.BTC 4H ChartBitcoin's value stayed within the 57.5k to 58.2k range throughout the day, showing no definitive breakout direction. If Bitcoin manages to break above the current resistance, we could potentially see a push towards 60k in the short term. However, if it drops below 57k, it might slide to 55.5k or even 54k. Such a decline would signal significant weakness, particularly within the current risk-on environment. Keep an eye on these key levels to gauge Bitcoin's next move.What is left for the market?The EXY recovered ground against the DXY on expectations of a slower rate cut by the ECB than the FED.Bitcoin continues to move sideways around 58k, a key area to break to continue the upside.Next week will be key to understanding the direction of the markets after the Fed's monetary policy decision.Stay cautious\u2014it\u2019s a wild market out there, especially if you\u2019re playing with leverage.\ud83d\udea9 AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

After bouncing off the 100.31 support, it finds itself in a precarious position, flirting with historical support levels not seen since 2023. With the market pricing in a 25bps rate cut, the DXY's near-term direction hinges on the Fed\u2019s next move, and whether a larger 50bps cut becomes the chosen path to steer the economy towards a soft landing.A 25bps cut might keep the DXY stable, but much will depend on the actions of other major central banks, like the ECB in the Eurozone and the BoJ in Japan. Their responses could either provide a cushion for the DXY or add further downward pressure. The dollar\u2019s fate isn\u2019t just in the Fed\u2019s hands\u2014it\u2019s also tied to how these global players react. A synchronized easing or divergence in policy paths could amplify the DXY\u2019s volatility in the weeks to come.Beyond rate cuts, the strength of the U.S. economy will be crucial for the DXY's trajectory. Weakness in upcoming job reports or economic activity could push the DXY below the critical 100 support level, eyeing 99.32 and potentially lower. Breaking these supports could spell trouble for the dollar, signaling a broader loss of confidence and potentially setting off a chain reaction in global currency markets.

It kicked off on Monday with a jump from $55k to $58.2k\u2014quite the leap\u2014and stayed in that range for most of the week. The initial surge came on the back of unemployment data that hit expectations, giving the market a nice, warm sense of stability. You know, the kind that makes investors feel all cozy and optimistic.\u2023\u00a0But then came the mid-week wobble. Bitcoin dipped to $55.5k ahead of a crucial CPI report. Was inflation creeping back in? Turns out, no. CPI came in tame, confirming inflation was under control. Bitcoin wasted no time bouncing back to $58k, in line with the overall \"hey, things are fine\" sentiment rippling through the markets. Thursday added more fuel to this narrative, with the ECB cutting rates, positive PPI data, and unemployment claims slightly above forecast. Still, it was enough to keep the market in a good mood. Despite all this, Bitcoin stayed just shy of $58k, suggesting it\u2019s in a holding pattern, waiting for a nudge in either direction.\u2023\u00a0What\u2019s been especially interesting this week is Bitcoin\u2019s increasing correlation with the stock market, particularly the S&P 500. On Wednesday, Bitcoin and the S&P were practically moving in sync, as if they were dancing together. If stocks show some bullish volatility on Friday, Bitcoin could break through that stubborn $58.2k resistance. And if it does? Well, we might just see it make a run towards $60k in the near term, riding the wave of risk-on sentiment and a potential market rally.Will Bitcoin Follow S&P 500\u2019s run to key resistances?BTC 1H ChartLet\u2019s look at the scenarios that could play out.\u2023Bullish Scenario:If Bitcoin can break through the $58.6k level soon, it\u2019s got a decent shot at a bullish run on Friday or over the weekend, potentially targeting $59.6k, $60k, or even $62k. The market loves a clean breakout.\u2023Bearish Scenario:But if Bitcoin gets stuck at resistance and drops below $57k, things could get ugly. We might see it slide back to $55.5k, $54k, or even as low as $51.7k\u2014not the weekend dip we\u2019re hoping for, but it\u2019s on the table.\u2023Neutral Scenario:If Bitcoin hovers between $57k and $58.2k over the weekend, it\u2019s basically hitting the pause button. This would keep the market guessing as we head into next week when the Fed starts its possible rate-cutting cycle.\u2023Forecast Flash:Bitcoin\u2019s had a pretty volatile week, jumping from $55k to $58k, thanks to news that\u2019s boosting the risk-on mood. If it can break $58.6k with a solid 4-hour candle, the odds are in favor of a push toward $60k-$62k.\ud83d\udea9AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

The big moment? A brief pop above the 57% mark, flirting with the previous high of 57.83%. But it couldn\u2019t quite push through, and we\u2019ve seen it trading sideways between 57.5% and 57.3% after all the economic news dropped on Wednesday and Thursday.\u2023 So, what\u2019s the deal? Well, the chatter around rate cuts is getting louder, with both the Eurozone and the U.S. looking for ways to keep the labour market chugging along and avoid an economic slowdown. If the Fed sticks to its plan in next Thursday\u2019s meeting, we might get that risk-on switch everyone\u2019s been waiting for. And when that happens, Bitcoin will likely be the first to benefit, boosting its dominance in the market\u2014at least in the short term.\u2023 Historically, when markets go bullish, Bitcoin is the star of the show, pulling in all the capital during rallies. But here\u2019s the thing: once investors start cashing out their gains, the money doesn\u2019t just vanish. It tends to flow into altcoins, meaning Bitcoin\u2019s dominance often retreats as profits are taken. So, while we could see Bitcoin continue to dominate in the near term, it\u2019s worth keeping an eye out for any signs of profit-taking. That\u2019s when the balance might start shifting, and the altcoins could have their moment in the sun.How could the scenarios for dominance unfold?BTC.D 1H Chart\u2023Bullish Scenario:If Bitcoin dominance manages to break above that 57.56% mark, we could see it climb to 57.67%, and maybe even hit 57.83%, which has been the ceiling of this sideways range since early August. It\u2019s like a test: can Bitcoin push through or will it stay stuck?\u2023Bearish Scenario:On the flip side, if Bitcoin dominance slips below 57.33%, we might be looking at a dip towards 57%, with some decent support waiting at 56.55%. If it breaks through there, it could be a sign that the tide is turning, and altcoins might start getting some love again.\u2023Neutral Scenario:If Bitcoin dominance remains between 57.5% and 57.3%, it will continue its sideways trend, maintaining the current market equilibrium.\u2023Forecast Flash:Bitcoin dominance hasn\u2019t done much this week\u2014just a small boost thanks to some news that nudged things in favour of a risk-on scenario.

The recent U.S. CPI data hit the mark at 2.5%, nudging dominance back into its comfort zone. Then, we got the EUR Main Refinancing Rate and U.S. PPI numbers\u2014both on target\u2014which caused a minor slip in BTC dominance but kept it in that tight range. Even U.S. unemployment claims at 230k barely made a dent.So, what\u2019s the takeaway here? Well, whispers of potential rate cuts in the U.S. are getting louder. Both the Eurozone and the U.S. seem keen to avoid an economic slowdown. If the Fed decides to hold steady in its meeting this Thursday, we might see the market flip to \"risk-on\" mode, with Bitcoin leading the charge. Typically, Bitcoin soaks up capital in bullish markets, pushing its dominance higher. But here\u2019s the twist: when profits start rolling in, investors often rotate into altcoins, pulling Bitcoin\u2019s dominance back down. So, while Bitcoin holds the spotlight for now, keep an eye out for profit-taking. That could signal altcoins are gearing up for their moment.Will BTC Smash 60% or Hit Resistance?Right now, Bitcoin's dominance is on a solid upward trend, thanks to a three-month breakout that's pushed it to around 57.93%. The next targets? We\u2019re looking at 60% and maybe even 63% if the momentum keeps up. Key levels to watch: there\u2019s strong support at 55% and resistance at 60%. A break above or below these could set off the next big move.Technicals support this bullish vibe. The trend line is pointing up, with the 20-day SMA (in red) leading the charge. The 50-day (in green) and 100-day SMAs (in purple) are also in line, reinforcing this upward path. Last week, BTC dominance even broke out of a mini-consolidation, crossing above 57.71%, suggesting strong dominance in the days ahead.And what about the RSI? It\u2019s holding steady at 64.79\u2014neutral territory. This means there\u2019s room for more growth without hitting the \"overbought\" panic button. So, while Bitcoin dominance looks strong, keep an eye on that 60% resistance level. A decisive break could set the tone for a major trend continuation.BTC/USDT: Stuck in a Channel, Which Way Next?The weekly BTC/USDT chart is showing signs of indecision. Price action is moving within a descending channel, with resistance near $70,000 and support around $50,000, hinting at medium-term bearish pressure. The latest candlestick puts Bitcoin at $58,345.99, marking a slight decline.Looking at the moving averages, the 20 SMA (red) is hovering above the current price, reinforcing the bearish vibe. However, the 100 SMA (purple) sits below, suggesting that the long-term trend might still have some bullish legs left. Volume is mixed with no major spikes\u2014buyers and sellers seem to lack conviction right now.The RSI sits at a neutral 48.69, adding to the uncertainty. The chart is signalling indecision, and a breakout from this channel will be key. A move above resistance could signal a trend reversal, while a break below support might pave the way for further declines.AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

That\u2019s no small feat considering the chaos in the markets lately. With a potential rate cut coming on Wednesday, September 18, people are starting to whisper about a \"risk-on\" scenario\u2014which could be good news for Bitcoin in the short term.Higher Lows: A Sign of Life?Here\u2019s the interesting part: Bitcoin formed a higher low at 52k during the week of September 2, breaking out of the downward channel that\u2019s been weighing on it since February. The previous low of 49k set the stage, and now, this higher low could be the first hint of a trend reversal. Could this be the beginning of a new bullish chapter for Bitcoin?What\u2019s Next for Bitcoin?For this trend reversal to really take off, Bitcoin needs to clear the key resistance zone between 63k and 66k. If it manages that, we could see a fresh wave of bullish confidence pushing the price higher. But until that breakout happens, Bitcoin is still in wait-and-see mode, with the broader market keeping one eye on the economy\u2019s next move.AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

Not exactly the ideal platform for decentralized finance, right? Enter Layer-2 networks, which have swooped in to help relieve some pressure by offloading traffic. But that\u2019s created a new problem: these Layer-2s are keeping the liquidity to themselves, leaving Ethereum\u2019s main chain feeling a bit neglected.Cue Based Rollups, a solution that lets Ethereum\u2019s main validators handle those Layer-2 transactions. The idea is that this could ramp up demand for ETH, making it much more integral to the whole system. According to Adam Cochran from Cinneamhain Ventures, this could be a \u201c100x\u201d game-changer for Ethereum. So, is this the fix Ethereum needs to stay on top of the DeFi world? It\u2019s looking pretty promising.How important are the Validators?Ethereum validators, the often-overlooked backbone of the network, might finally get their time in the spotlight thanks to Layer-2 integration. With validators handling Layer-2 transactions, ETH staking becomes more attractive, offering higher rewards and reducing Ethereum\u2019s need to inflate its supply just to pay those staking rewards. This keeps ETH scarce, a win for anyone concerned about token supply. Then there\u2019s the Dencun upgrade that launched in April, briefly putting Ethereum back into inflationary mode. But here\u2019s the twist: Based Rollups could help flip the script by generating more fees, burning more ETH, and bringing back those deflationary vibes everyone loves. Not everyone\u2019s concerned about inflation, though. Ryan Berckmans points out that lower fees can actually boost adoption, making ETH more usable as everyday currency\u2014so, lower fees might not be all bad.While Crypto Twitter might be singing the blues about Ethereum\u2019s current state, the truth is the network is arguably in its best shape ever\u2014at least from a technical standpoint. The big question now is whether Ethereum can live up to its vision of becoming a truly decentralized financial system. If it can pull it off, ETH might finally secure that elusive \"monetary premium\" everyone\u2019s been whispering about.ETH/BTC: More Downside Ahead or a Short-Term Bounce?The weekly chart for ETH/BTC isn\u2019t exactly shouting \"bull market!\" It's locked in a descending channel, making a series of lower highs and lower lows. In short, it's a downtrend. A recent breakdown from the Darvas Box only adds to this bearish vibe, confirming that the pair is stuck in a downward momentum.The moving averages aren't throwing ETH any lifelines either. The 20-week moving average (in red) acts as resistance, while the 100-day moving average (in purple) sits in a strong resistance zone, perfectly in line with the lower-high structure. In other words, ETH is up against a solid barrier.Now, let\u2019s talk support. The 0.035 zone is a key level to watch, sitting right along the lower trendline of this descending channel. The RSI is hanging out at 30.63, which is pretty close to oversold territory. That could mean a short-term bounce is on the horizon. But here\u2019s the kicker: the volume isn\u2019t showing any real signs of life. No buying frenzy to counteract this slump\u2014at least, not yet.On a side note, keep an eye on Based Rollups. They\u2019re expected to boost ETH demand by integrating more closely with Ethereum validators, potentially offering juicier staking rewards. This could lead to a supply crunch as more ETH gets locked up, driving prices higher. But for now, ETH\u2019s in a tough spot on the chart.Can Ethereum Break Through Its Resistance Roadblocks?The weekly chart for Ethereum (ETH) against the US Dollar shows it's in a bit of a jam. Currently sitting at $2,301.66, ETH has been struggling to break past the 50-week moving average (in green) for the last seven weeks\u2014acting like a stubborn ceiling. And to make things worse, former support zones have flipped into resistance, adding to the uphill battle. The Darvas Box breakdown even lines up with this resistance, making upward momentum a real challenge.But not all hope is lost. On the support side, the 100-day moving average (in purple) suggests there\u2019s some buying interest waiting in the wings. Plus, the key level formed after the Bitcoin ETF consolidation could act as a support area if things get dicey.Market sentiment, however, isn't exactly rosy. The RSI sits at 38.69, which is well below the neutral mark, and there\u2019s a bearish divergence signalling that momentum is fading.So, what's the big picture? ETH is up against a pretty tough technical landscape right now. But rollups could change the game\u2014they\u2019re designed to boost Ethereum's scalability and cut transaction costs, which might make ETH more attractive to users and developers in the long run. For now, though, it\u2019s a waiting game to see if ETH can overcome these resistance hurdles."}]}

If you\u2019re in the crypto space, this might sound like music to your ears. A \"risk-on\" environment is exactly what Bitcoin needs to make another run at previous highs. Lower rates mean cheaper money, and that tends to drive investors towards riskier assets, which could give Bitcoin a solid boost alongside traditional assets like the S&P 500.Now, here's where things get interesting. If the Fed opts for a larger 50bps cut, it could signal underlying concerns about the economy\u2014a hard landing scenario where employment and consumption might take a hit. In that case, even though a 50bps cut would normally sound bullish for Bitcoin, the broader fear in the markets could actually weigh on risk assets, leading to unpredictable volatility.S&P500 4H ChartAll Eyes on Powell: Will He Be Hawkish or Dovish?Jerome Powell\u2019s speech after the rate decision will be pivotal. If his tone suggests more cuts are on the horizon, Bitcoin could rally on optimism. However, if he keeps rates \"higher for longer,\" we might see a market pullback. For Bitcoin, this could mean a cooling-off period, as investors reassess risk in a more hawkish economic environment.UK CPI: Bitcoin's Unexpected Wild Card?While all eyes are on the Fed, the UK's inflation data (CPI) might be the quiet game-changer for global markets\u2014and yes, that includes Bitcoin. If the UK surprises with lower-than-expected CPI numbers, it would suggest inflation is under control without tanking the economy. That kind of news could spark global optimism, creating a \"risk-on\" mood, which is exactly the kind of environment where Bitcoin thrives.But if UK inflation stays stubbornly high? Well, then central banks may need to keep tightening the screws. That means risk appetite could shrink across the board, dragging Bitcoin down along with other speculative assets. So, while the Fed gets the spotlight, the UK CPI could be the wild card that shakes things up for Bitcoin.Bitcoin\u2019s Tug of War: Will Rate Cuts Send Prices Soaring or Sinking?If the Fed surprises with a 50bps rate cut, Bitcoin might not be celebrating. It could face significant downward pressure, closely mirroring movements in the S&P 500. Traders are eyeing the $57.5k area as a key support level, but if bearish momentum intensifies, Bitcoin could slip further, potentially testing the $54k\u2013$51k range. A sharper rate cut could signal deeper economic fears, triggering a broader market selloff that would impact risk assets like BTC.On the flip side, a 25bps rate cut\u2014right in line with market expectations\u2014could serve as a green light for Bitcoin\u2019s bulls. This scenario would likely see Bitcoin consolidating above the $62k level, with momentum building towards $65.5k. Such a move would align with the overall \"risk-on\" sentiment, boosting BTC alongside traditional markets.Volatility Reigns: BTC's Recent Price SwingsBitcoin has already been on a rollercoaster ride lately. After bouncing off the $52.7k level, BTC recently rejected the $60k zone on Monday, reflecting the current volatility. By Tuesday morning, it had clawed its way back to $60k after bouncing from $57.5k, highlighting just how sensitive the market is to macroeconomic cues. Keep your seatbelt fastened; Bitcoin\u2019s next move is likely to hinge on the Fed's rate decision.BTC 4H ChartWhat is left for the market?The S&P 500 continues its bullish momentum, hovering around 5,680 ahead of Wednesday's anticipated rate cut, which could potentially push it to new highs.Bitcoin held firm at $57.5k, bouncing back to $61k on Tuesday, with optimism building as the market anticipates a possible rate cut.A 25bps rate cut would likely trigger a positive market reaction, but a 50bps cut could introduce a negative bias despite theoretically benefiting a broader \u2018risk-on\u2019 environment.Stay cautious\u2014it\u2019s a wild market out there, especially if you\u2019re playing with leverage.AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

They were once Supports 1 and 2, holding ADA steady after the Grayscale crash, but now they\u2019ve flipped into resistance zones. Same goes for Resistance 1\u2014it used to be a key support during the June cyber attack, catching the price as it fell.Since April, ADA\u2019s been moving in a slow, sideways drift, and the current Support 1 ($0.3305) and Support 2 ($0.3119) are the real safety nets. ADA hasn\u2019t dropped below these levels since November 2023, so while it\u2019s not rallying, it\u2019s also not crashing. As long as these supports hold, ADA\u2019s staying afloat.A Deeper Technical Look\u2023 Cardano (ADA) has experienced a brutal 41.68% nosedive from March to April, crashing to Resistance 4 at $0.4517 (previous Support level). In May, despite attempts to stage a comeback, it slipped another 30.93%, stabilising between Resistance 1 at $0.3615 and Support 1 at $0.3305.\u2023 Additionally, ADA saw a 29.20% rise that briefly broke through Resistance 2 at $0.3929 and Resistance 3 at $0.4204, sparking hopes of a recovery. However, this upward momentum was short-lived, and ADA continued to cling to Support 1. Impressively, since November 2023, it hasn't tested Support 2 at $0.3119, and the lower supports at $0.2761 and $0.2420 remain untouched, acting as unused safety nets.From Grayscale Snub to Cyber ScrapesBack in April, Grayscale dropped ADA from its portfolio.

Not great for investor confidence.Now, here we are in September, and Cardano just rolled out its Chang upgrade. It\u2019s got people buzzing, with promises of better scalability and performance.

Over the past 38 days, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has dropped from $84.61 billion to $79.54 billion, which is hardly cause for celebration. Yet, while the broader DeFi market takes a nap, liquid staking platforms are sneaking ahead, closing in on the 14 million ETH milestone.Defying Gravity: Liquid Staking's AscentYou\u2019d think the DeFi slowdown would drag everything down, but liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) are playing by their own rules. On August 10, 13.59 million ETH were locked in LSDs; fast forward to September 17, and it\u2019s grown to 13.99 million ETH. That\u2019s 400,000 more ETH\u2014about $943 million worth\u2014flowing in despite the market turbulence. Why? Investors are flocking to the steady yields of staking, while keeping their assets liquid, as a safe bet in an unpredictable market.Lido\u2019s Dominance Slips\u2014But Just a LittleLido still reigns supreme in the liquid staking space, holding 69.85% of the market's 13.99 million staked ETH. Impressive, right? But it\u2019s actually a slight dip from 72.23% last month. Is Lido losing its edge? Not quite. While Lido\u2019s ETH stash is growing, competitors are catching up faster, suggesting a maturing and increasingly competitive market.Binance Steps Up: Second Place with a SurgeBinance\u2019s Staked Ether app is making waves, leaping from 912,902 ETH staked in August to 1.32 million ETH now. That surge has catapulted Binance into second place, pushing Rocket Pool to third. The ease and familiarity of Binance's platform are drawing in retail investors who might otherwise shy away from staking.Rocket Pool's Rocky Ride and Frax\u2019s Tempting YieldsRocket Pool may have slipped to third, but it\u2019s not out of the game yet. The network\u2019s infrastructure is quietly growing, with more node operators and minipools coming online, even as its staked ETH dips. Meanwhile, Frax is offering juicy yields\u20143.46% on sfrxETH and 5.51% on the frxETH/WETH pair\u2014tempting those willing to take on a little extra risk.The Bigger PictureWhile DeFi takes a breather, liquid staking platforms are gathering momentum, nearing the 14 million ETH milestone. Lido remains dominant, but competitors like Binance and Frax are gaining ground. Investors seem drawn to the stability and yields offered by staking, suggesting that even in a market downturn, there\u2019s always room for growth\u2014and competition. As the landscape evolves, keep an eye on these platforms. In crypto, today\u2019s trend could shape tomorrow\u2019s market leaders."}]}

Now, chains can just waltz in by issuing a transaction\u2014no permission slip required\u2014unless they're aiming for the \"Top N\" club, which is still kind of exclusive (because we all need something to aspire to). More chains mean more action, and potentially, more value for those shiny ATOM tokens jingling in your digital pocket.ICS with Inactive Validators (Prop 930)In the old days\u2014which, in crypto time, is like two weeks ago\u2014only the \"active\" validators got to be part of the cool kids' table. Prop 930 is basically the Cosmos version of \"everyone gets a participation trophy.\" Now, inactive validators can jump in and help secure consumer chains. It's like the benchwarmers finally getting some playtime, and who knows, maybe they'll score some points. This could make the network more secure and decentralized because spreading the validation love reduces the risk of centralisation\u2014a word that in crypto circles is pronounced like a curse.Removing Unbonding Pausing from ICS (ADR 018)Ah, \"unbonding pausing.\" Just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? It's about as exciting as watching paint dry, except the paint occasionally causes network inefficiencies. This feature linked non-delegation on the Cosmos Hub to consumer chains, adding layers of complexity that nobody asked for.ADR 018 is like Marie Kondo showing up and asking if this feature sparks joy. Spoiler: It doesn't. So they're tossing it out, streamlining the system, and making everything run smoother\u2014like switching from dial-up to fiber optics.Why It Matters\u2023Accessibility:By letting chains launch without the cosmic bureaucracy of governance approval and inviting inactive validators to the party, Cosmos is basically putting up a giant \"Everyone's Welcome\" sign. Lower barriers to entry mean more projects might think, \"Hey, why not?\" and join the ecosystem.\u2023Efficiency:When you have fewer moving parts, there's less stuff that can break. It's like driving a stick shift versus an automatic; fewer things to fiddle with means you can focus on the road\u2014or in this case, on making the network faster and less prone to those pesky issues that keep developers up at night.\u2023Security and Decentralisation:Letting more validators participate is like having multiple bouncers at the club door. It strengthens the network's resilience and keeps the bad actors out. Plus, reducing centralisation risks makes everyone sleep a little better, except maybe the centralisers.Wrapping It UpLook, the Gaia v20 upgrade isn't just another item on a long list of updates you'll never read about again. It's a significant move that could reshape how the Cosmos ecosystem functions\u2014or at least make it a bit less convoluted. It's about making things easier, faster, and more secure, all while potentially boosting that ATOM value you've been watching like a hawk.Whether you're an investor pondering your next move, a developer looking for the next big thing, or just someone who enjoys the rollercoaster that is the crypto world, Gaia v20 is worth more than a passing glance. This could be the upgrade that doesn't just open new doors but also adds a few windows and maybe a skylight."}]}

Yes, I know, it\u2019s the topic that sends eyes rolling faster than you can say \u201cdistributed ledger technology,\u201d but stick with me\u2014this might actually be interesting, or at least faster. Polkadot, the multi-chain network that\u2019s like the Switzerland of blockchains, just made a big move called Asynchronous Backing, and it could be a game-changer.The 12-Second ProblemPolkadot has parachains\u2014specialized blockchains connected to its main Relay Chain. Think of the Relay Chain as the main airport hub, and parachains as individual flights trying to avoid delays. Traditionally, parachains produced blocks every 12 seconds, which, in the fast-paced world of crypto, feels like waiting in line at the DMV. Collators\u2014basically the folks who collect transactions and build blocks\u2014had a pretty tight window to get everything done.The Six-Second FixEnter Asynchronous Backing, Polkadot\u2019s solution to this problem. Instead of waiting for the latest Relay Chain block, collators can now build on older blocks. It's like starting dinner even if all the ingredients haven\u2019t arrived yet. The result? Block times drop from 12 seconds to six. That's the blockchain equivalent of moving from dial-up to fiber optic internet\u2014seriously fast.Teamwork Makes the Blockchain Dream WorkWhat\u2019s cool is that Polkadot didn\u2019t just roll this out alone. A small team at Parity Technologies worked with early adopters like Mythical Games and Moonsong Labs to test it. These teams were the guinea pigs, providing invaluable feedback that helped improve the process. Think of it like being the first to try a new rollercoaster and telling everyone else where the twists and turns are.PoV Reclaim: Packing Smarter, Not HarderThen there\u2019s PoV Reclaim\u2014a fancy term for packing more efficiently. Previously, Polkadot had to overestimate the size of transaction proofs, wasting valuable block space. Now, they\u2019re packing smarter, not harder, making room for more transactions. Combined with Asynchronous Backing, this could boost performance up to 10x. Bigger blocks, produced faster, with more efficient use of space\u2014it\u2019s like upgrading from a sedan to a supercharged SUV.What\u2019s Next? Polkadot 2.0This isn\u2019t just a one-time upgrade. It\u2019s part of Polkadot\u2019s broader plan for Polkadot 2.0, which includes even more flexibility and scalability with features like Agile Coretime and Elastic Scaling. These upgrades are crucial for high-throughput applications, like blockchain-based games where every sword swing or trade is a transaction. Without improvements like this, blockchain gaming would feel slower than a dial-up modem loading a GIF.The Bottom LinePolkadot\u2019s Asynchronous Backing is a solid step toward making blockchain technology faster and more efficient. It shows that incremental improvements\u2014like shaving six seconds off block times\u2014can have huge impacts. And hey, it\u2019s not just about speed. The upgrade makes blocks bigger and packs data more efficiently, making Polkadot more scalable for real-world applications.So, next time you\u2019re waiting those long, agonizing seconds for a blockchain transaction to go through, take comfort in knowing that somewhere, someone is making that wait just a little shorter\u2014and they\u2019re writing a helpful guide about it, too."}]}

Thanks to Referendum 1129, the network boosted its validator count from a modest 297 to a bustling 400, and that\u2019s not even the end goal. They\u2019re aiming for 1,000 validators by next year. It\u2019s like upgrading to a bigger venue and sending out even more invites. But, you know, in blockchain terms.The Nakamoto Coefficient\u2014Wait, What?Polkadot\u2019s Nakamoto Coefficient just jumped 20 points to 112. Great news, but let\u2019s break it down. The Nakamoto Coefficient measures decentralisation, telling you how many validators it would take to control over a third of the network's stake. So, in Polkadot\u2019s case, 112 validators would need to team up to do anything sketchy. More decentralisation equals better security, so this jump is definitely a win.Does More Validators Mean Better Security?The whole idea behind increasing validators is to strengthen decentralisation. Think of it like adding extra layers of security to a concert\u2014more guards, fewer chances of trouble. But then there\u2019s the age-old question: Can you have too much of a good thing? Eventually, adding more validators might feel like overcrowding the kitchen with too many chefs. Does it make the network safer, or just more chaotic?Meet GRANDPA (Yes, Really)Polkadot uses the GRANDPA consensus mechanism. Yes, that\u2019s the actual name. It means that all validators have equal voting power, regardless of how much stake they hold. So, it\u2019s like a democracy where everyone\u2019s vote counts the same, whether you're a crypto whale or just getting started. Add in the Phragmen election algorithm (say that five times fast), and Polkadot makes sure everything is balanced and fair. Validators shuffle in and out of the active set every 24 hours. It\u2019s like a blockchain version of musical chairs, but with way more maths.Scaling Validators Without Breaking the ChainPolkadot\u2019s goal of scaling up to 1,000 validators isn\u2019t just about showing off. More validators mean the network can process more transactions, opening the door for more projects to join. But here\u2019s the tricky part: scaling up without losing quality. It\u2019s like expanding a restaurant chain\u2014you want more locations, but you don\u2019t want the food to taste worse.What\u2019s the Deal With ChainflowPOS?Polkadot\u2019s high decentralisation score comes from ChainflowPOS, an independent team that tracks validator decentralisation across networks. Basically, they\u2019re like the auditors of the blockchain world. Polkadot\u2019s high Nakamoto Coefficient means its Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) system is doing its job, but numbers are one thing, and real-world results are another. Time will tell.Final ThoughtsPolkadot\u2019s move to increase validators seems smart\u2014more decentralisation, more security. But scaling up always brings new challenges. Will this make the network more resilient, or just introduce more complexity that could become a headache down the road?"}]}

The market was already pricing in a rate reduction, but the size was the real wildcard. A 50bps cut isn\u2019t your everyday move; it\u2019s more like pulling out the big guns. Naturally, eyebrows were raised, and whispers of recession fears started making the rounds. But then Jerome Powell stepped up to the mic to tell us what's what.Powell\u2019s Pitch: It\u2019s Not What You ThinkPowell focused on explaining the reasoning behind such a hefty cut. Forget the recession chatter\u2014he reckons the cut was perhaps fashionably late. With inflation on a steady downward path, keeping rates high might unnecessarily hobble employment. And let's face it, letting jobs slip just because you dragged your feet on rates isn't a good look. He assured us there's no recession looming on the horizon: GDP is growing solidly, unemployment is hanging around a healthy 4%, and the industrial sector is showing some muscle.Markets React: Stocks and Bitcoin Get a BoostThe markets seemed to appreciate Powell's message. The S&P 500 didn't just nod in approval; it broke its all-time high. Bitcoin wasn't about to miss out on the fun either, bouncing from $60k up to $62k by the day's end. Investors took the dovish tone as a green light, signalling that more rate cuts could be on the table if the numbers play nice. It\u2019s like the market collectively said, \"Alright, let's roll with this.\"S&P500 4H ChartWhen Cheap Money Meets Digital GoldSo, the Fed decides to cut rates, and suddenly everyone's looking at their bond portfolios like outdated phone books. High-yield bonds were fun while they lasted, but now that the rate-cut cycle is kicking off, investors are itching for something a bit more... exhilarating. Enter Bitcoin. In these \"risk on\" scenarios, capital starts flowing from the safe, comfy world of fixed income into the wild west of risky assets, where the returns might just make your head spin\u2014or your stomach drop.Breaking Barriers and Eyeing New HeightsBitcoin didn't just tiptoe past the $60,000 resistance level; it bulldozed through it. This was the key hurdle keeping it from stretching its legs upward, and now that it's cleared, things are getting interesting. Currently testing the $63,000 waters, Bitcoin has also breached the $62,500 mark. Next up? The elusive $65,000 zone\u2014the last high it couldn't quite conquer.Now, if Bitcoin manages to pull off a higher high by breaking past $65,000, it'll be more than just a number on a screen. It would shatter the trend that's been in place since February, where it's been making lower highs. A decisive move above $65,000 could set the stage for a run toward at least $70,000. Because, why not?BTC 4H ChartWhat is left for the market?FED slashes rates 50bps, Powell\u2019s dovish stance sparks risk-on vibesS&P500 rockets above its ATH and Bitcoin surges in bullish response pulling away from 60k.A strong labour market could keep risk assets on a tear.Stay cautious\u2014it\u2019s a wild market out there, especially if you\u2019re playing with leverage.AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

Lower rates mean cheaper borrowing, which typically floods the market with more liquidity and a higher appetite for risk, setting the perfect stage for Bitcoin and its blockchain buddies to strut their stuff.Think of it as the Fed turning down the interest rate thermostat, making traditional savings as appealing as a soggy sandwich, and nudging investors toward the shiny, unpredictable world of crypto in search of those elusive higher returns. Plus, if inflation decides to throw a tantrum later, Bitcoin might just don its superhero cape as the decentralised hedge against a weakening dollar. So, while the Fed fiddles with rates like a DJ at a party, crypto markets are ready to remix the financial playlist\u2014grab your digital snacks, because this track could get wild.What Just Happened?Think of the Fed\u2019s rate-cutting decisions as the central bank playing with the economic thermostat. When they cut rates, it\u2019s usually to keep the economy from overheating or to fend off a chill. And yesterday, they cranked the dial down by half a percent. Fed Chair Jerome Powell framed it as a way to \u201cmaintain strength in the labour market while moderating growth and pushing inflation down to 2%.\u201d Translation: keep things humming without letting inflation run wild.The Big Cut: Are They Fixing a Mistake?A 50 basis point cut isn\u2019t just a tweak\u2014it\u2019s a statement. Some economists, like Michael Feroli at JP Morgan, are clapping for the Fed, saying it was about time they got serious about bringing rates down to a \u201cneutral\u201d level of around 3%. But others? They see it as an admission of error, a sign that the Fed may have overcooked previous rate hikes. Are we watching the Fed correct its course, or are they just trying to steer the ship away from the choppy waters they created?A Blast from the PastBefore we get swept up in the market\u2019s excitement over the Fed\u2019s hefty rate cut, let\u2019s take a quick trip down memory lane. In 2007, the Fed kicked off a rate-cut cycle with the S&P 500 near its peak, and while stocks celebrated briefly, they soon tumbled, with the S&P ultimately losing 57%.The last time we saw a cut this big was March 2008, amid the Great Recession. Markets initially cheered, but it didn\u2019t take long for things to unravel. Even in 2020, when the pandemic hit, big rate cuts eventually helped the market rebound\u2014but only after a sharp and painful crash. So, are we heading for a rerun? Stocks are flying high, bond yields are plummeting, and gold is glittering, but seasoned investors might advise holding off on popping the champagne\u2014this party could be short-lived.Fed Chair Powell: Confident or Just Hopeful?Fed Chair Jerome Powell reassured us that this move reflects \u201cgrowing confidence\u201d in maintaining a strong labour market and taming inflation. In other words, he thinks they can pull off the balancing act of cooling inflation without crashing the economy. It\u2019s the central bank version of patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time.The Crypto AngleFor crypto investors, lower rates could boost interest in riskier assets like Bitcoin. With traditional savings yielding next to nothing, more liquidity might flow into digital assets as investors hunt for higher returns. And if inflation picks up down the road, Bitcoin could shine as a hedge against a weakening dollar.The Bottom LineThe Fed\u2019s 50 basis point cut is a bold move that sent waves through the markets. Whether it extends this economic expansion or signals storm clouds ahead is yet to be seen. For now, enjoy the rally, but stay cautious\u2014because in finance, history has a way of repeating itself."}]}

While stocks partied, the U.S. dollar decided to take a nap, with the Dollar Index (DXY) falling 0.56% to its lowest level since July 2023, hitting 100.21. So, what\u2019s really going on here, and why does this matter for the U.S. economy? Let\u2019s break it down.The Dollar Takes a HitAs soon as the Fed announced the rate cut, the dollar faced serious selling pressure. The DXY dropped to 100.21 before regaining some ground to close at 100.68. Still, the broader trend suggests a weaker dollar on the horizon. Barclays\u2019 forex strategist Lefteris Farmakis summed it up nicely: \u201cThe Fed\u2019s decision was quite dovish, which bodes well with a rebound in risk and further near-term U.S. dollar weakness.\u201dWhy Is the Dollar Sliding?When the Fed cuts rates, the yield on U.S. assets decreases, making them less attractive to foreign investors. So, naturally, they start looking for higher returns elsewhere, leading to a sell-off in the dollar. Add in the fact that lower rates often boost risk appetite\u2014encouraging investors to ditch the dollar for riskier bets like stocks or emerging markets\u2014and you\u2019ve got a recipe for a weaker greenback.What This Means for the EconomyA weaker dollar can be a mixed bag for the U.S. economy. On the upside, it makes American exports cheaper and more competitive globally. This could be a boon for the manufacturing sector. But on the downside, a weak dollar makes imports pricier, which can drive up inflation. That means higher costs for everyday goods like electronics and clothing, which could put a squeeze on consumer spending.The Fed\u2019s Messaging: Dovish but Not PanickyLeading up to the Fed meeting, there was speculation over whether the cut would be 25 or 50 basis points. The Fed went bigger, signalling a proactive stance to keep the economy on track. Chair Jerome Powell tried to reassure everyone, saying, \u201cWe do not see any indication of a recession or even an economic downturn ahead.\u201d But the market\u2019s reaction suggests some underlying nerves.Already Seen or Something New?This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen the dollar take a hit after a big Fed cut. During the Great Recession and the early pandemic days, aggressive rate cuts weakened the dollar. But those periods were marked by clear economic distress. This time, the signals are more mixed, leaving investors trying to figure out whether this is just a preemptive move or a sign of something bigger."}]}

The flagship cryptocurrency surged to a three-week high, breaking past $63,000 during the Asia trading session. But is this the start of a sustained rally, or are we seeing a familiar pattern from past Fed cuts? Let\u2019s unpack how the Fed\u2019s move is shaking things up in the crypto world and what it might mean for Bitcoin going forward.The Fed\u2019s Bold Move: 50 bps and CountingThe Fed\u2019s decision to slice 50 basis points off interest rates was bigger than most had expected. Sure, some market players were leaning towards it, but most economists had been betting on a more modest 25 bps cut. By going large, the Fed is signalling it\u2019s serious about keeping economic growth on track while managing inflation.Bitcoin\u2019s Surge: Why Did It Jump?As soon as the Fed\u2019s announcement dropped, Bitcoin jumped 3.5%, crossing the $63,000 mark. That\u2019s a solid 24-hour gain, with the broader crypto market also enjoying a 4.48% lift. It seems investors are viewing Bitcoin as a solid \u201crisk-on\u201d asset in this low-interest-rate environment. When borrowing becomes cheaper, traditional investments lose their lustre, and riskier assets like Bitcoin look more attractive. Even crypto-related stocks like Coinbase and MicroStrategy got in on the action, seeing their shares climb by 4% and 5%, respectively.Is This a Repeat of 2020?The last time we saw a cut of this magnitude was back in March 2020, as the pandemic was turning the world upside down. Back then, Bitcoin initially tanked but soon rebounded in a spectacular fashion, hitting new all-time highs by year\u2019s end. The surge was fueled by institutional adoption and a broader shift toward viewing Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty. So, is this rally following the same script?Well, not quite. Unlike 2020, this cut doesn\u2019t come amid a full-blown crisis, but rather as a proactive move to keep the economy stable. Still, the market loves liquidity, and Bitcoin is often the beneficiary when there\u2019s extra cash sloshing around.A Look Back: How Bitcoin Reacts to Rate CutsWhile Bitcoin didn\u2019t exist during the Great Recession, it\u2019s worth noting that rate cuts like the ones in 2007 and 2008 initially boosted markets before things went south. The S&P 500 surged after the Fed cut rates in 2007, but that rally was short-lived, with the market eventually tumbling 57%. If history is any guide, this latest Bitcoin rally might be followed by some volatility down the line.What\u2019s Next for Bitcoin?The immediate reaction to the Fed\u2019s cut is bullish, but the long-term picture remains murky. Bitcoin\u2019s inherent volatility means the next few months could be a rollercoaster. For now, the liquidity boost from lower rates is pushing prices up, but the real test will come as we see how the broader economy reacts to this aggressive rate-cutting strategy."}]}

Why? Simple: lower rates mean cheaper borrowing, fewer returns on safe assets, and suddenly riskier bets\u2014like crypto\u2014start looking a lot more attractive. With liquidity pouring in, investors chasing yield see Ethereum not just as digital magic money but as a real opportunity. So, in the strange new world of finance, when the Fed sneezes, Ethereum catches a bid.Ethereum\u2019s Rally: Riding the Fed WaveEthereum clearly liked what it heard. After the Fed\u2019s announcement, Ethereum surged to $2,437, marking a 4.8% bump. Investors suddenly seemed very interested in the second-largest cryptocurrency. In a world where low-yield investments are looking less and less attractive, Ethereum\u2019s promise of higher returns starts looking pretty good. And it wasn\u2019t just Ethereum\u2014Bitcoin also jumped, and the whole cryptocurrency market found itself lifted, with the total market cap climbing to $2.16 trillion. Not bad for a day's work.Of course, it\u2019s not like Ethereum\u2019s been without challenges. Decentralized app (DApp) volume is down 19%, but apparently that didn\u2019t matter much in the face of all this liquidity flooding the market. The fact that Ethereum still managed to rally despite some underlying issues shows how resilient it can be when the Fed starts shaking things up.How Does This Stack Up Against Past Rate Cuts?This isn\u2019t the first time Ethereum\u2014or the market in general\u2014has reacted to a Fed rate cut. In March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, the Fed slashed rates by a similar 50 basis points. Ethereum took a hit at first, as markets panicked, but it didn\u2019t take long for things to turn around. By the end of the year, Ethereum had hit new all-time highs, thanks to increased institutional interest and the rise of DeFi and NFTs.Why Is Ethereum Going Up?Ethereum is what you\u2019d call a \u201crisk-on\u201d asset. When people are feeling bold, they like to bet on things with higher potential returns\u2014like Ethereum. So, when the Fed cuts rates and suddenly makes safer investments like bonds a lot less attractive, people start looking for something with more upside. Enter Ethereum.But it\u2019s not just about chasing returns. Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is also seen as a hedge against inflation. If investors think inflation is going to stay higher than the Fed\u2019s 2% target, they might turn to Ethereum as a way to protect their wealth from losing value.What Happens Next?The big question is, where does Ethereum go from here? Sure, it\u2019s enjoying this post-Fed rally, but we\u2019ve seen this story before. Rate cuts tend to inject more liquidity into the system, which can push up prices in the short term. But crypto is volatile, and Ethereum\u2019s no exception. History suggests we could see some sharp corrections if the broader economy starts to wobble or if investors start to get cold feet.Plus, as more institutions adopt Ethereum, we\u2019re likely to see it become even more sensitive to things like Fed policy. That makes it both more mainstream and more subject to the same forces that move traditional markets."}]}

This move has essentially flipped the market into \u201crisk on\u201d mode, which means traders are now looking at riskier assets, like Bitcoin and altcoins, with a bit more enthusiasm.But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. In the short term, the index has some immediate support to watch. First up is that previous all-time high, and then we\u2019ve got the $5300 level, which was where the market settled after the August 1st unemployment claims report. That report caused a bit of a panic\u2014pushing prices down across the board. Classic market drama.Where\u2019s the S&P500 Headed Now?Technically, the S&P500 is in uncharted territory. Once you break an all-time high, it\u2019s kind of like sailing into unknown waters. But let\u2019s bring some order to the chaos. By plotting a Fibonacci retracement (yes, the magic lines that traders love), we can estimate that the next resistance levels could be around $5824 to $6000. If the index pushes through that, we\u2019re looking at targets between $6500 and $6950. It\u2019s like a video game\u2014hit a level, break the level, and move to the next.Of course, if things go south and the main support at $5638 gives way, we could be heading back down to the $5300-$5100 zone. Not ideal, but hey, the market does what it wants.The Fed\u2019s New Obsession: EmploymentIt\u2019s becoming pretty obvious that the Fed is glued to one thing: the strength of employment in the U.S. economy. And here's the kicker\u2014if the unemployment claims keep coming in lower than expected, it\u2019s like giving the market the green light to keep climbing higher. That\u2019s good news for both the S&P500 and Bitcoin.But don\u2019t just focus on weekly reports. The real action will come from the monthly unemployment rate. This number will be key in determining how fast the Fed cuts rates in the months ahead. If employment stays strong, expect the markets to keep searching for those higher resistances. If not? Well, buckle up."}]}

Now, normally, that kind of thing would have had investors running for the hills, but this time? Totally different story. The markets loved it. The S&P500 broke through its all-time high, heading towards $5,700, and Bitcoin didn\u2019t disappoint either\u2014blasting past its $60k resistance and making a quick run to $64k in just two days.\u2023 Well, it\u2019s all about the Fed\u2019s rate cut, right? It\u2019s one of those \u2018risk on\u2019 moments. When Powell took the stage and gave a speech that could only be described as \u2018dovish,\u2019 it was basically the green light for traders to jump in. Statistically, when you get positive macroeconomic news like this, markets rally, and Bitcoin? It tends to lead the charge.Bitcoin Dominance: What\u2019s the Deal?\u2023 Here\u2019s the fun part. When Bitcoin\u2019s feeling good and everything's rallying, its dominance tends to spike. You see, when traders hear good news, the first place they pour their money is into Bitcoin. And historically, that happens before they start cashing out and moving their capital into riskier altcoins. It\u2019s like Bitcoin is the opening act, and the altcoins are the main event\u2014just a bit delayed.Bitcoin is, well, Bitcoin. It\u2019s the most relevant cryptocurrency by far, and when things are looking up, most of the new capital entering the crypto space heads straight for Bitcoin, especially since ETFs exist. So naturally, its dominance tends to increase when everyone\u2019s piling in. It\u2019s a bit like Bitcoin saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got this,\u201d before the altcoins join the party.How could the scenarios for dominance unfold?BTC.D 1H Chart\u2023Bullish Scenario:Alright, here\u2019s where it gets interesting. If Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) can form support around the 58% mark, we might see a quick jump to 58.4%, and then potentially 58.7%\u2014the level where the 2024 high is sitting pretty. Now, if Bitcoin dominance keeps climbing and hits the short-term target of 59.45%, things could get a bit rough for altcoins, especially if the total market cap (TOTAL) doesn\u2019t follow suit.\u2023Bearish Scenario:But here\u2019s the catch: BTC.D has already dipped from that 58.4% area, and right now, major support is holding around 58%. If that level breaks, we\u2019re looking at a short-term drop to the 57.7%-57.5% zone.\u2023Neutral Scenario:BTC.D would hover between 57.7% and 58.4% in the weeks following this first rate cut. It\u2019s like Bitcoin is trying to decide whether it\u2019s in charge or if it wants to let the altcoins have some fun.\u2023Forecast Flash:Dominance broke through the 58% barrier, giving Bitcoin a solid boost, but then\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014it pulled back overnight after the rate cut news dropped. Now we\u2019re back to testing that 58% support level again. If it cracks, well, altcoins could finally get their moment in the sun, at least in the short termAI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}

This wasn\u2019t totally out of the blue\u2014early August brought signs that the job market was cooling off, prompting a shift in market sentiment. Suddenly, \u201cgood news is good news again,\u201d meaning that looser monetary policy might be just what the doctor ordered for risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins.So, while the DXY could keep slipping, and the dollar could weaken, this shift could be a boon for riskier assets. If the Fed keeps cutting rates, we might see continued pressure on the DXY, but it could also mean a boost for those risk-on markets like crypto, as global monetary policies move in tandem.DXY Teeters on the Edge: What\u2019s Next for the Dollar?So, the DXY (the dollar index) just tested its biggest psychological level\u2014100. And why is this happening? Well, the Fed just cut interest rates by 50 basis points, which is quite a pivot from the rate-hiking spree we saw after COVID to keep inflation in check.For a while, the 100 level has been this magical floor. It\u2019s been holding since April 2022 when the Fed first started raising rates. But now that they\u2019re cutting, if the DXY dips below 100, where does it land? Analysts say we could be looking at 99, 98, or even 96.45 as the next stops on this rollercoaster.Why This Level Matters So MuchThe DXY has been flirting with a reversal zone dating back to May 2021, which starts around 99. It\u2019s also where the next major support level is, should the dollar break below 100. Fun fact: this zone marks the bottom of a descending channel the DXY has been following since 2008. And here\u2019s the thing about long-term trends\u2014they rarely break. So, if 100-99 gives way, it could be a big deal, pushing the index down to the 96-95 range.And what\u2019s at stake? Well, breaking below that level could mean the dollar\u2019s macro trend, which has held for over a decade, could officially shift. Think of it like the dollar losing its mojo. If the DXY falls to the 90 areas, where the 2021 lows are, we\u2019re talking about a new lower low, which could spell even more weakness for the greenback."}]}

Not So MuchThe Fed shocked everyone by cutting interest rates by 50 basis points when most folks were expecting 25. So what happened next? Well, Bitcoin ETFs partied like rockstars, pulling in $158 million in net inflows. Ethereum ETFs, though? They were kind of the awkward wallflower at the dance, managing just $5.2 million. It\u2019s like watching a high school movie where Bitcoin is the jock at the cool kids\u2019 party, and Ethereum didn\u2019t even get the invite. Let\u2019s break this down.Before the Fed Cut: Bitcoin\u2019s the Prom King, Ethereum\u2026 Not So MuchIn the days leading up to the Fed\u2019s big moment, Bitcoin ETFs were flexing\u2014hard. Over $500 million flowed into these funds between September 12 and 17. Bitcoin was soaking up all the attention, while Ethereum ETFs? Well, they were busy losing money. On Tuesday alone, Ethereum ETFs bled $15.1 million, and by Wednesday, another $9.8 million had walked out the door. Grayscale\u2019s ETHE was leading the charge in this sad parade, shedding $14.7 million.The only saving grace for Ethereum? BlackRock\u2019s shiny new ETF, EHTA, which managed to scrape together $4.9 million in inflows. Not exactly mind-blowing, but hey, at least it wasn\u2019t a net loss.After the Fed\u2019s Big Move: Bitcoin Takes a Breather, Ethereum Still MIASo, the Fed pulls the trigger on a 50-basis-point cut, and what happens? Bitcoin ETFs take a breather. On Wednesday, they saw $52.7 million in outflows. ARKB had a rough day, losing $43.4 million, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC dropped $8.1 million, and BITB chipped in with another $3.9 million in losses.But because the crypto world loves drama, Thursday rolls around, and boom\u2014Bitcoin ETFs are back with a vengeance. Suddenly, $158 million comes flooding in. ARKB, the same ETF that lost $43 million the day before, now magically pulled in $81 million. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC wasn\u2019t far behind with $50 million in inflows, and even Grayscale\u2019s BTC trust, which usually has more mood swings than a teenager, brought in $9.5 million.And Ethereum ETFs? Well, BlackRock\u2019s ETH ETF managed to grab $5.2 million, which isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s not exactly front-page news. The rest of the Ethereum crowd? Crickets.Why Is Bitcoin Getting All the Love?So, why is Bitcoin getting all the attention while Ethereum\u2019s stuck on the sidelines? It boils down to one thing: Bitcoin plays the inflation hedge game way better. Bitcoin\u2019s got that \u201cdigital gold\u201d narrative, and when the Fed cuts rates like it\u2019s trying to juice the economy on Red Bull, people pile into Bitcoin ETFs because they think, \u201cInflation hedge, safe haven!\u201dEthereum, though? Ethereum\u2019s got a lot going on\u2014DeFi, staking, smart contracts\u2014but its story is way more complicated. And when it comes to ETFs, simplicity sells. Investors don\u2019t want to sift through the complexities of decentralized applications; they want a clean, easy-to-understand narrative. Right now, Bitcoin\u2019s story is just simpler: store of value, hedge against inflation, done.Can Ethereum Catch Up?Does this mean Ethereum\u2019s destined to live in Bitcoin\u2019s shadow forever? Not necessarily. Ethereum\u2019s got a lot of potential but its ETF story is still being written. It\u2019s going to take time for institutional investors to see Ethereum\u2019s long-term potential in the same way they view Bitcoin as a straightforward inflation hedge.For now, though, Bitcoin\u2019s the jock, winning all the popularity contests, while Ethereum\u2019s still trying to figure out how to make its case. But don\u2019t count Ethereum out just yet. The fundamentals are there, and as the market moves past its obsession with rate cuts and inflation, Ethereum could finally start to shine."}]}

First, U.S. Retail Sales data from September 17 came in a little better than expected, showing 0.1% growth versus the -0.2% forecast. That pushed BTC.D above 58%, with it settling around 58.5%. Then, when the Fed cut the Federal Funds Rate to 0.5%, Bitcoin dominance inched up again, hitting 58.6%. The trend didn\u2019t stop there\u2014by Thursday, after U.S. unemployment claims came in higher than expected at 230K, dominance peaked at 58.7%.So, what does that mean for the broader market? Well, when Bitcoin dominance rises, it\u2019s like Bitcoin taking center stage. New capital flows into Bitcoin first\u2014it\u2019s the safe, familiar choice. But historically, once Bitcoin\u2019s dominance stabilizes, altcoins get their moment to shine. It\u2019s almost like Bitcoin\u2019s saying, \u201cI\u2019ve had my fun, now it's your turn.\u201d So if BTC.D continues to rise, don\u2019t be surprised if an altcoin rally is just around the corner.Is Bitcoin Dominance About to Cool Off?Bitcoin dominance has been riding an upward wave for months, recently breaking through key resistance and sparking bullish momentum. Right now, it\u2019s holding steady above 57.03% support, with its eye on 60% resistance, and even a target of 63% if things keep heating up. The Fed\u2019s surprise 0.5% rate hike on September 18 played a major role, pushing BTC.D to 58.6%, though it cooled off a bit later.The indicators are looking strong\u2014dominance is sitting above key moving averages\u2014but with the RSI edging into overbought territory, we might see some consolidation or a minor pullback. Keep an eye on how Bitcoin dominance moves around these levels as traders process the rate news.Bitcoin: Breakout or Consolidation Ahead?Bitcoin's weekly chart is showing some intriguing signals. It\u2019s been stuck in a descending channel for a while, marking its bearish trend. Currently priced around $63,535, Bitcoin is flirting with the upper boundary of this channel, sitting less than 10% away from key support. The 20-week moving average (in red) is critical right now\u2014Bitcoin is testing it as support, and a breakout above could signal a bullish run.The long-term picture looks stable, with the 100-week moving average (in purple) far below as strong support that hasn't been tested yet. Volume is picking up, especially on bullish candles, indicating that buyers might be accumulating. With the RSI hovering around 50, Bitcoin\u2019s next move could go either way. A breakout, confirmed by rising volume and RSI pushing above 60, would suggest a bullish reversal. But if momentum fades, further consolidation or a retest of lower levels might be ahead.AI Alpha is an educational tool and does not offer financial advice."}]}
